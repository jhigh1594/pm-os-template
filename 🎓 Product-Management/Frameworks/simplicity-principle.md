# Simplicity > Complexity

**A working principle for product management and communication.**

---

## Core Belief

> **Simplicity creates clarity and action. Complexity should earn its place.**

---

## What Simplicity Means

**Simplicity is the right amount of information for the audience—no more, no less.**

It creates **immediate understanding** and **actionable clarity**.

### Why Simplicity Is Hard

| Challenge | Why It's Hard |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Deep understanding required** | You have to understand deeply before you can simplify well |
| **Forces exclusion** | You have to make choices about what *not* to include |
| **Demands confidence** | Simplicity exposes shallow thinking—complexity hides it |
| **Requires iteration** | First draft is never the simplest. You have to rewrite repeatedly. |

### Why Complexity Tempts Us

| Psychological Driver | Manifestation |
|---------------------|---------------|
| **Laziness** | Easier to add than remove. Easier to use jargon than find plain language. |
| **Fear** | "What if I leave out the one thing that matters?" |
| **Signaling** | "If I make this sound complex, I look smart." |
| **Ambiguity avoidance** | More words = more room to be right *somewhere*. |
| **Academic conditioning** | Scholarly writing rewards density, not clarity. |

**Insight:** Complexity is often the path of least resistance. Simplicity requires discipline.

## When Complexity Is Justified

Complexity earns its place when it serves **genuine understanding**:

| Appropriate Complexity | Example |
|------------------------|---------|
| **Genuinely intricate systems** | Explaining distributed system failure modes, why they occur, and trade-offs in handling them |
| **Multi-variable trade-offs** | A pricing model that captures real market dynamics and competitive pressures |
| **Regulatory requirements** | Compliance constraints that genuinely affect product decisions |
| **Technical constraints** | Architecture decisions shaped by real limitations |

This is **instrumental complexity**—complexity that illuminates.

### Inappropriate Complexity

| Performative Complexity | Example |
|------------------------|---------|
| **Signaling** | Using jargon to sound knowledgeable rather than communicate |
| **Laziness** | Adding "just in case" features rather than deciding what matters |
| **Covering ambiguity** | Long documents that avoid taking a clear position |
| **Effort justification** | "We spent 6 months on this, it must be sophisticated" |

This is **performative complexity**—complexity that obscures.

## Diagnostic Questions

When you encounter complexity, ask yourself:

1. **Who is this for?** (Is this the right audience?)
2. **What's the one thing they need to know or do?** (Core insight?)
3. **What can I remove without losing meaning?** (Exclusion exercise)
4. **Can I say this in half the words?** (Compression test)
5. **What am I afraid of leaving out?** (Fear diagnostic)

---

## The Length Fallacy

Many people mistake **longer = more complex = better**. This shows up everywhere:

| Domain | Manifestation | Simpler Alternative |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Documents** | 20-page docs | One clear position, 2 pages |
| **Email** | 5 paragraphs | 2 bullets that actually say something |
| **Meetings** | 60 minutes | Asynchronous decision + 10-minute sync if needed |
| **Presentations** | 47 slides | 3 insights that matter |

**Counter-intuition:** Long is often a signal that thinking isn't done. If you can't say it briefly, you might not know what you're actually saying.

## How This Shows Up in Product Management

| Situation | Complexity Trap | Simplicity Win |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Strategy** | 7-pillar framework, nothing actionable | One clear bet we're making |
| **Stakeholder updates** | 12-slide status deck | On track / Blocked / Decision needed |
| **Customer communication** | 4-page feature announcement | "You can now X in 2 clicks" |
| **Team alignment** | All-hands marathon | One-page brief everyone references |
| **PRDs** | Documenting every edge case | Problem → Solution → Success criteria |

---

## Key Insight

> **Complexity is often a shield. Simplicity is a weapon.**

Complexity protects you from criticism ("I covered everything!") but prevents action. Simplicity exposes your thinking ("Here's what I believe") but enables progress.

## In Practice

### Before You Communicate

1. **Identify the audience** — Who needs to understand this?
2. **Find the core insight** — What's the one thing that matters?
3. **Cut everything else** — Ruthlessly remove what doesn't serve the core.
4. **Use plain language** — Jargon as a last resort, not a first instinct.
5. **Test it** — Can you explain it to someone outside your domain?

### When Reviewing Your Own Work

1. **Count the words** — Can you say it in half?
2. **Find the jargon** — Replace with plain language.
3. **Look for hedging** — "May," "might," "could" → Say what you mean.
4. **Check for "just in case"** — If it's not essential, cut it.
5. **Ask: What did I leave out?** — If nothing, you probably didn't choose strongly enough.
