# Improving Strategy Development with a Strategy 5x5

Managers striving to become great leaders are frequently asked to "get
more strategic."

But learning about strategy can feel like falling into the deep end of
the pool with doggy-paddle skills and water wings. It's a rich and deep
field that draws from, and supports, a range of business, military, and
organizational contexts. It's not something that's easy to pick up with
some light reading on a cross-country flight.

It would be nice if we could start to codify the concepts (from the many
great thought leaders in the space) and find ways to activate the work
of strategy development. Mastery will only come from experience, so how
can we get started?

You can start by giving yourself some enabling constraints, for the work
of strategy development. Constraints that aim to take a wide open space
("you can do anything!"), and make it more manageable for you and your
leadership team ("where can, and should, we focus"?). We seek to
assemble a constrained space that can reasonably drive great dialog (in
a three-day strategy offsite, for example).

Here is a mock up of a facilitation tool that could help with this.
Let's call it the Strategy 5x5:

*Sample mock-up of a Strategy 5×5*

Let's take a step back, though, and remind ourselves why strategy
development is so hard.

#### **Strategy development is confusing**

Is it about planning? Should it be about exploring my context (e.g.
product strategy), or done in conjunction with the other (i.e. business)
leaders? Is it about creating a good set of goals? Is it about crafting
a vision? A mission? Is it about seeing into the future, with scenario
planning? Should I call out the uncertainty? Sweep it under the rug and
pretend it's not there? Try to quantify it all into probabilities? Help!

#### **Strategy development takes time**

Strategy requires creative thinking, which takes time and collaboration.
Time is in short supply, though. Plus, strategy requires a mindset that
is a polar opposite of the tactical day-to-day monitoring and
fire-fighting that consumes most of our hours. So we recognize that we
need to carve out dedicated time for the activity (e.g. 3-day offsite,
or annual strategy summit). But how much time is needed? And how much
time is appropriate, given our needs?

#### **Strategy development requires bold choices**

It is not fun to make decisions that will impact colleagues' career
opportunities (e.g. when the impact is seen as negative, in their eyes).
It is also not fun to make decisions with incomplete information.
Strategy forces a choice across multiple options (each of which are
probably "pretty darn good") so FOMO will be lurking. You'll have to
move past this fear to find focus, though.

#### **Strategy development needs safety**

Your organizational culture will shape the quality of the strategy.
Strategy means "saying no" to good options and making some people
unhappy. Is there enough psychological safety to support this kind of
dialog?

Plus, sometimes we will "say no" to options where, with hindsight, we
should have said "yes". What are the ramifications for leaders in these
situations? By the way, your fellow leaders already know the answer (and
they are already acting accordingly...).

It would be useful to have a "thinking model" that could:

1.  Minimize the confusion,

2.  Make good use of our time,

3.  Highlight the needed choices, and

4.  Remind us of the uncertainty we face (and the need for humility)

The good news is that there are many great "thinking models" out there.
Thought leaders like Roger Martin, Richard Rumelt, and Simon Wardley
(just to name a few) offer crisp, coherent approaches for strategy
development.

What we have noticed is that they have a similar structure - a structure
that can help us define, explain, and craft a consistent strategy
development activity in our organizations:

-   They describe strategy as an intense, thoughtful exercise that is
    > both removed-from, yet wholly-within the operational experience of
    > leaders.

-   They describe strategy as an integrated set of choices

-   They stress that strategy guides and constrains actions and plans,
    > but is not "planning"

-   They highlight that strategic dialog requires a vocabulary that
    > supports concepts in complexity and uncertainty (e.g. "emergence"
    > and "hypotheses")

Could we leverage this observation to find something useful for
facilitation? What would we need?

Something that:

-   Distills the concepts, but is not overly simplified

-   Makes the concepts visual, to support communication during the
    > activity

-   References the advice of experts in the field (instead of creating a
    > new approach)

-   Allows leaders to choose which experts' ideas are the best fit for
    > their context

-   Builds a common understanding, with a common vocabulary

-   Supports learning (for leaders) and building a craft around strategy
    > (for the organization)

-   Produces adaptive strategies, less of a static deck and more of a
    > "living" thing

-   Supports good decision making, in a reasonable amount of time

-   Uses a vocabulary that acknowledges uncertainty and complexity

-   Connects into the resource/budget planning exercises that constrain
    > the organization

To set the table (and that is actually a helpful way to think about what
we are doing... putting a "game board" out on a table, for people to
gather around...), let's lock down some definitions (and positions) on
strategy development. \[Hopefully, these are just clarifying, and not
controversial.\]

-   Strategy is an integrated set of *choices*

-   Choices come from *decisions*

-   Decisions are framed by *questions*

-   Decisions move *resources* (ie. investments to pursue a path)

-   Decisions can be revisited, as *learning* lessens *uncertainty*

Our "game table" (i.e. "Strategy 5x5") is composed of these sections:

1.  The campaign

2.  The decision framework

3.  The possibility space (5x5)

4.  The candidate possibilities (paths through the space)

5.  The results (e.g. funding of preferred possibility as desired path)

![](media/image4.png){width="6.5in" height="4.041666666666667in"}

*Composition of a Strategy 5×5*

Let's see how this could help with the main challenges we face:

#### **Challenge #1: Time**

We have to carve out time to develop strategy, so let's be explicit
about it. We create a *campaign* that identifies a fixed amount of time
(e.g. 3-day offsite, or a dedicated week, or a series of meetings over a
month), a small number of active participants (covering different
perspectives), and a workflow that matches the approach (guiding the
development).

![](media/image2.png){width="6.5in" height="1.7916666666666667in"}

We can also set expectations (in our workflow) on how and when the
strategy will impact our desired outcomes. Here is an example (this will
depend on context):

-   *Initiate strategy campaign (1-3 days)*

-   *Create and commit to strategy (1-3 weeks)*

-   *Align strategy with execution plans (1-3 months)*

-   *Implement and deliver on strategy (1-3 quarters)*

-   *Evaluate impact of strategy (1-3 years)*

#### **Challenge #2: Concurrent decision-making**

Since a strategy is an "integrated set of choices", this implies that we
need to commit to a set of related decisions. These dependencies (a good
thing!) will drive us to approach the challenge of strategy development
as making a few important decisions concurrently, instead of approaching
them sequentially.

We have noticed that thought leaders usually frame their guidance as a
set of questions to explore. We use these questions to build a specific
*decision framework* that distills their recommendations into a small
number of decisions-to-make. Since we will need to consider these
decisions concurrently, we aimed for a number that wouldn't place too
much of a cognitive load on the participants. While the number is
arbitrary, in most cases, we found we could successfully distill an
author's ideas down to five key "decisions-to-make". Here are a few
examples of decision frameworks, drawn from the work of popular thought
leaders:

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Strategy Cascade      | Strategy Kernel       | Strategy Cycle (on a  |
|                       |                       | Wardley Map)          |
| \[Roger Martin\]      | \[Richard Rumelt\]    |                       |
|                       |                       | \[Simon Wardley\]     |
+=======================+=======================+=======================+
| Winning aspiration?   | Most significant      | *Climatic pattern*s   |
|                       | challenge?            | we are anticipating?  |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Where to *play*?      | *Diagnosis*?          | *Doctrines* to apply  |
|                       |                       | to the map?           |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| How to *win*?         | *Method* to guide us? | *Gameplay* to use to  |
|                       |                       | influence the map?    |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Must-have             | Coordinated actions   | From what position    |
| capabilities?         | to impose on the      | should we start an    |
|                       | system?               | *attack*?             |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Key business systems? | Concentrated actions  | What should be the    |
|                       | to deliver change?    | direction of movement |
|                       |                       | (and why)?            |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

These decisions-to-make are each framed as a question, and the
subsequent exploration usually involves new learning (i.e. new
vocabulary or new ideas, shown in italics above). We expect that these
decisions can each be supported by the organization's [decision
architecture](https://www.theuncertaintyproject.org/threads/patterns-of-decision-architecture?utm_source=blueprint.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=improving-strategy-development-with-a-strategy-5x5).
For example, each decision-to-make can be framed as a "1-way door" or
"2-way door", can assign decision authority to an owner, can support
collective understanding of the context before idea generation, can
drive divergent thinking to produce options (i.e. more than 5) before
converging (on best 5 for the grid), etc.

The added twist is that the decisions should not reach their respective
"commit" until the options have been considered collectively across the
decisions-to-make.

The strategy choice, then, consists of an integrated set of options,
with an option drawn from each distinct decision-to-make. We call each
distinct path through the options a *possibility*, and the 5x5 grid a
*possibility space*.

#### **Challenge #3: Bias**

We construct this possibility space (i.e. the 5x5 grid) to help us
minimize the impact of bias on our dialog. Here is how:

-   [Status Quo
    > Bias](https://www.theuncertaintyproject.org/bias/status-quo-bias?utm_source=blueprint.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=improving-strategy-development-with-a-strategy-5x5) -
    > By representing the options that define the status quo alongside
    > the alternative "change options", leaders can more objectively
    > evaluate continuing with the direction of the status quo.

-   [Confirmation
    > Bias](https://www.theuncertaintyproject.org/bias/confirmation-bias?utm_source=blueprint.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=improving-strategy-development-with-a-strategy-5x5) -
    > By focusing on the relationship *between* options (from multiple
    > decisions-to-make), participants with different perspectives must
    > go beyond defending their pre-existing beliefs.

-   [Availability
    > Cascade](https://www.theuncertaintyproject.org/bias/availability-cascade?utm_source=blueprint.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=improving-strategy-development-with-a-strategy-5x5) -
    > The experience of building possibilities with a decision framework
    > avoids the trap of pre-mature extrapolation, where large
    > slide-decks force a discussion that jumps to early convergence.

#### **Challenge #4: Uncertainty**

With a Strategy 5x5, we look for the best combination of options across
the set of five questions. We refer to this best combination as a
*possibility*, to highlight the uncertainty in the evaluation. This will
be one of those times where decisions must be made with incomplete
information. The "40-70 rule", attributed to Colin Powell, suggests that
leaders should feel comfortable making decisions when they feel like
they have at least 40% of the information they want, but no more than
70% (to avoid "analysis paralysis").

The enabling constraint of the 5x5 grid helps us avoid "analysis
paralysis" by limiting the breadth of the dialog. Of course there will
be times when our dialog drives the group to swap out one option for a
different one, but, even then, the constraint (25 "tiles") should hold.

Once a possibility has been defined (i.e. a path through the possibility
space), it should be further clarified with a hypothesis statement. By
using a syntax that begins with "We believe that..." we can make it
crystal clear that, while the direction has been set, uncertainty
remains with the choice.

#### **Challenge #5: Adaptability**

Strategies can get stale and lose value when they fail to adapt to
changes in the context. A strategy that gets presented via slides in a
January town hall meeting might be laughably irrelevant by April.

When we tie the options ("tiles") in the 5x5 grid to supporting
materials (i.e. conditions, metrics, beliefs, active projects, OKRs,
teams, etc.) we can monitor how this context changes over time. In some
cases, a change in the context might warrant bringing the participants
"back to the game board" to revisit the evaluation, and consider
alternate directions.

Since the "decisions-made" in strategy development drive resource
allocation, we will need to balance the desire for adaptability ("should
we change?") with the organization's ability to reallocate resources
("can we change?"). More adaptive budgeting practices can support more
adaptive strategy development practices.

Overall, strategic dialog produces focus for the organization. But the
*activity* of strategy development sometimes needs help focusing, to
produce good decisions. The Strategy 5x5 is designed to improve
visibility across multiple, concurrent decisions, and leverage
industry-best guidance, to make a leadership team more efficient and
effective in their strategy practice.

It also supports continuous learning, since different frameworks can be
swapped into the Strategy 5x5 while retaining the feel of the "game
board" (say, from one year to the next).

If you're facilitating a strategy development process in the near
future, and need some help organizing your thinking, give it a try!

# **Exploring possibilities, together**

## Examples of Strategy 5x5s for business and product leaders

In last week's newsletter, we introduced a visualization called the
[*Strategy
5x5*](https://blueprint.beehiiv.com/p/improving-strategy-development-with-a-strategy-5x5).
It's a facilitation tool, and it aims to make the potential choices for
a strategy more visible, which could help produce better dialog within a
leadership team.

We made the argument that it could help leaders improve their strategy
practice by supporting better:

-   Clarity - each one tries to distill a known strategy framework into
    > some guiding questions

-   Efficiency - in constrains the dialog to choosing amongst 5 options,
    > for each of 5 decisions

-   Decision-making - it builds on elements of good *decision
    > architecture*

-   Guards against bias - it can be used to challenge the status quo and
    > combat confirmation biases

The layout frames the dialog to help us navigate uncertainty and
complexity:

-   Potential strategies are considered as *possibilities* and evaluated
    > against each other

-   Strategy is defined as a coherent set of choices, and the options
    > across the individual decisions form a *possibility space*

-   We explore the options by tying them to our *beliefs*, which are
    > crafted with probabilistic thinking

-   The preferred possibility that emerges from the dialog is framed
    > (and funded) as a *hypothesis*

-   It supports a time-bound strategy development campaign, but can also
    > be treated as a *living document*, to adapt the choices to new
    > realities, as conditions change

Last week, we shared an example of a Strategy 5x5 that was built around
Roger Martin's *Strategy Cascade*, and his concept for evaluating
possibilities by asking "what would have to be true?" (*WWHTBT*). Over
the next few weeks, we will introduce more examples of Strategy 5x5's,
that distill other leading strategy frameworks into the same form.

We've loosely categorized the frameworks we've done so far (based on the
audience for which they're best suited):

-   Business unit or product leaders - accountable for driving revenue

-   Technical leaders - accountable for effectively leveraging new
    > technology and methods

-   Mid-level leaders - accountable for making local choices that make
    > an impact

This week, we will take a tour of four Strategy 5x5s in the first
category: exploring possibilities for business unit of product leaders.
The strategy frameworks and authors we will show are:

Over the next few weeks, we will offer a similar treatment for ideas
from Simon Wardley, Mark Schwartz, Jonathan Smart, Dave Snowden, Marc
Benioff, and Martin Eriksson.

But for this week, let's focus on the needs of leaders of business
units, like directors, or Heads of Product. They tend to have
responsibility for a P/L and deeply understand the competitive
landscape. As they oversee a portfolio of products (or services), they
talk in terms of *offers*, applying an *outside-in* mindset.

There is no right, or wrong, or best framework for this. Each of these
examples (and many more that are out there) can be a good fit for a
leader's needs at the moment. And next time, in a different moment, a
different framework might ask better questions to help you find your
best answers. In fact, different frameworks can be complementary - each
bringing a different lens or angle to the possibility space. \[It might
make sense to use a different one each time you sponsor a strategy
development campaign!\]

For now, think of the Strategy 5x5 as a canvas - something that could be
supported in a workshop, maybe by a whiteboard tool. To make it a living
canvas, however, better tooling would be required. We'd need tooling
that could connect the options and choices to external sense-making (and
corresponding beliefs) and to internal progress (and the current beliefs
around that). If we could connect the dots like this, the possibility
space could "come alive" and support adaptive strategy.

How would you know whether the Strategy 5x5 is helping? You would know
when you see the dialog (e.g. in a 3-day offsite, or a quarterly review)
being influenced by the structure of the new view. Leaders would refer
to "decisions-to-make" and how options for those form a "possibility
space" and how any possibility should be described as a "hypothesis"
that can be worthy of funding (or "bets").

And that's just the influence of the layout. The deeper value comes from
learning (and applying) one of these strategic frameworks, with their
rich vocabulary and industry-proven methods.

Our goal here is not to explain or summarize the books referenced above
(our advice: get the books!). Our intent is to show you how we can
distill the core ideas from different frameworks into a common format
that helps leaders apply it in practice, i.e. with a facilitated
workshop. Obviously, the more knowledgeable your team is on the
framework, the better the results.

Maybe start a book club for those with an interest in "becoming more
strategic". Don't expect everyone to read them, but you'll need to find
a facilitator that can effectively apply the ideas to your context.
\[Hint: Think about how you can leverage your decision architecture to
support the exploration and learning needed to produce good options.\]

And please remember: the five-point *decision frameworks* that follow
are just my gross (over-)simplification of a much-deeper, much-richer
strategy framework. They are just an attempt to distill some ideas from
the author into five core questions that could activate a good dialog.

### **Better, Simpler Strategy**

*Decision Framework:*

-   What customer segments are we targeting with this offer?

-   Who are our key suppliers (including employees)?

-   Which value drivers should we target?

-   How can we drive change in WTS/WTP, for our targeted value drivers?

-   How should we change how the value gets distributed/realized?

![](media/image9.png){width="6.5in" height="4.041666666666667in"}

*Strategy 5×5 based on Better, Simpler Strategy*

This approach works great for leaders seeking to close the gap between
"engineering" and "the business", or for product leaders that know they
need to increase their Business IQ. It leans heavily into the ideas of
"willingness to pay" (WTP) and "willingness to sell" (WTS) to build a
(yes, simple!) definition of value creation that is less fuzzy, and more
actionable. The entire conversation gets centered around a single offer,
maybe start with an existing one.

For this specific offer, it works to identify the targeted customer
segments *and* the internal suppliers behind the construction of the
offer (including employees). Value is created and distributed across
this new axis: some to the customer, some to employees and suppliers,
and some retained by the firm as margin.

The possibility space is constructed to help leaders explore the best
value creation opportunities for the offer. It explores value in the
eyes of the customer, value in the eyes of a supplier, and value in the
eyes of employees - all on equal footing. Then it considers how pricing,
supplier rates, and competition might influence choices and the desired
outcome: healthy margins.

The best possibilities are marked as paths through the possibility
space. Oberholzer-Gee refers to these possibilities as "strategic
moves". A strategic move would integrate choices on a segment (or
supplier or employee) where value will be created, the value driver we
are seeking to increase, the specific idea, and the proposed
distribution of the new value (on the "value stick").

Map](https://www.theuncertaintyproject.org/threads/value-based-strategy?utm_source=blueprint.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=exploring-possibilities-together)
support the dialog, as possibilities are evaluated against each other.

### **Blue Ocean Strategy**

*Decision Framework:*

-   What \'non-customer\' segments could form a new buyer group?

-   Where are there opportunities for new Blue Ocean offerings?

-   What are the competing factors in our current industry?

-   What action will we take for each competing factor?

-   What price should we set for the new offering?

![](media/image6.png){width="6.5in" height="4.041666666666667in"}

*Strategy 5×5 based on Blue Ocean Strategy*

This approach supports leaders focused on finding growth opportunities.
It seeks to craft new offers in market segments where the feeding frenzy
of competitive pressures are less "bloody" (a "blue ocean", not a "red
ocean"). It asks leaders to explore the adjacencies, to find a buyer
group that is not feeling the love from the market today. Then it seeks
to define a potential new offer in ways that avoid direct competition on
the same old factors, and instead finds unique combinations of factors
that can help it stand out. Pricing is obviously a crucial part of this
conversation.

The possibility space is built with the different options for target
buyer groups, offer types, factors, which actions to take to emphasize
or de-emphasize a factor (for differentiation), and different price
points.

The combinations or paths through the space will outline potential new
offers. They would integrate a specific buyer group with an offer type,
then call out the key factor(s), and how it would be emphasized. Pricing
choices could finish the rough description enough to evaluate how well
it could differentiate (go "blue").

W. Chan Kim & Renee Mauborgne offer some simple, yet expressive
visualizations for finding opportunities (the *Buyer Utility Map*) and
comparing factors (the *Strategy Canvas*), that can support the search
for options on the decisions, and the subsequent dialog.

### **Hierarchy of Powers / Competitive Separation**

*Decision Framework:*

-   Who is in our competitive set? \[Company Power\]

-   What are our \'crown jewels\' and/or \'core capabilities\'?
    > \[Company Power\]

-   In which segment should we start a target market initiative (TMI)?
    > \[Market Power\]

-   What differentiating aspect(s) should form the core of our offer?
    > \[Offer Power\]

-   What asymmetric bet are we making on our innovation investments?
    > \[Offer Power\]

![](media/image7.png){width="6.5in" height="4.041666666666667in"}

*Strategy 5×5 based on Hierarchy of Powers*

This approach is designed to help leaders "free your company's future
from the pull of its past", per Geoffrey Moore. It aims to create
*competitive separation,* via new offers, to move beyond the status quo.
It is built around his model, called the "hierarchy of powers", that
shapes the structure of the book, Escape Velocity. We've pulled a couple
of the models in the book to use here.

Since the goal is competitive separation, the first choice is defining
the *competitive set*, one or more companies that will compete for
market share. After that "outside-in" exploration, we turn "inside-out"
to claim our *crown-jewels* or *core capabilities* that form a source of
our relative strength. Then it's back to clarifying the *segment* and
identifying what *aspects* can help with differentiation (sound
familiar?). Lastly, he emphasizes the need to make an asymmetric *bet*
on building this aspect, for this segment, leveraging this core
capability, to differentiate from this company (or companies). So we
include the nature of the bet as a decision as well.

This combination can be written up as a hypothesis: the theory that
supports the bet.

Moore has many simple visualizations (he calls them models) that help
illustrate ideas across the "hierarchy of powers". Two that are relevant
here are the *Competitive Set*, and the *Core/Context model*. Use these
to help identify options for the possibility space.

### **Strategy Kernel / Strategy Foundry**

*Decision Framework:*

-   What is our most significant challenge?

-   What is our diagnosis?

-   What method or approach will guide us?

-   What coordinated actions must be imposed on the system?

-   What concentrated actions will deliver change?

![](media/image10.png){width="6.5in" height="4.041666666666667in"}

*Strategy 5×5 based on Strategy Kernel*

This approach is fairly generic. While Rumelt illustrates his books with
examples from the C-suite, his concepts can be applied at any level in
an organization. The key is to start with a *challenge* that that
leaders are facing, in their local context.

This is also where the possibility space for this Strategy 5x5 unfolds a
bit differently (in our interpretation of Rumelt's work). Once you lock
down a specific *challenge* to focus on, the rest of the possibility
space should keep that focus. So you look for five alternate diagnoses
of the challenge, then rally around the most promising one. Then you
explore remedies, or methods, to address the diagnosis. Then for a
promising method, you explore the needed coordination action (i.e. the
kind only leaders can provide) and the needed concentrated actions
around change (also sponsored actively by the leaders).

While you could explore the five decisions independently to create the
possibility space, this one works better when the decisions-to-make are
approached more sequentially.

The paths through the possibility space are what Rumelt calls a "guiding
policy". It's got enough action behind it to create momentum, but it's
not explicit as a solution (still more about the "what" than the
specifics of the "how").

Since so much springs from the choice of the challenge, Rumelt offers a
way to evaluate options there. Construct a simple visualization of the
*Addressable Strategic Challenges (ASC)* by scoring each candidate
challenge on two dimensions: a relative score for importance
(criticality), and one for addressability (like feasibility of solving
for it). Plotting the challenges across these two axes supports dialog
(hint: look in the upper right quadrant).

In his Strategy Foundry, which is an example of a multi-day strategy
development campaign, Rumelt emphasizes learning from recent projects in
the organization. Get leaders talking about the reasons why some
projects didn't succeed. That should surface some challenges. It also
helps clarify what coordinating and concentrated actions might be needed
in a new guiding policy. So while it's not a visualization per se... put
those on the table as well.

Hopefully, these examples help you picture how a Strategy 5x5 could
shape and steer dialog in your next strategy meeting. By borrowing smart
lines of questioning from the world's best thought leaders on strategy,
we can drive [new ways of
thinking](https://www.amazon.com/New-Way-Think-Management-Effectiveness-ebook/dp/B09KHKWB7B/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2RRLW164VUA16&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.7u9yMlhGJYTneOLVFBJEuaaHF3q3YCqMJk85QkI8Q8t19gY4kKkVo_CwnTfWxwxIBr2Y1XZo5_cTEMuTkDq2vXa6q21r9rvV_aqkqLzumtzaQ-bALAWoSXlVALYOEMSkZlonZPxeE5bG9intTE1madGepYM3QuAFB5wT23MAW4Bd50QnPu7TZGqBWVVbg1NUfvDqBNTIPuXlLmMh4CTN7_0htqhRVB5rhbe7bYN_EefT3gOW2EZ0wjWRvPreuIhrcYore9DYLcbJYA1T7ClHSA.gBcg4RnAzYSIVeYK_fosdSMywmT4snSAHWkqWpkuVKE&dib_tag=se&keywords=roger+martin+new+way&qid=1736450069&s=digital-text&sprefix=roger+martin+new+way%2Cdigital-text%2C111&sr=1-1&utm_source=blueprint.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=exploring-possibilities-together)
(to borrow again from Roger Martin) and fight the status quo. By
constraining the size of the grid, we bring focus and efficiency to the
meetings. By building on a [decision
architecture](https://www.theuncertaintyproject.org/threads/using-a-decision-architecture?utm_source=blueprint.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=exploring-possibilities-together),
we can avoid the common traps of poor decision making.

And by connecting our choices to the output of strategy development -
focused investments - we can increase the leverage of our strategy
decisions.

As Rumelt said in the last sentence of his latest book:

❝

"Good strategy is about focus, not about everything that everybody
does."

Richard Rumelt, "The Crux"

# **Getting started, exploring possibilities**

## Examples of simple Strategy 5x5s for mid-level managers

This week, we will close out our series on the strategy facilitation
canvas we call the *Strategy 5x5*. In the last two newsletters, we've
shared examples that support good strategic dialog - some for business
leaders, and then some for technology leaders. Here, we will offer
examples that can be used by mid-level leaders, like department managers
or even team leads. The intent is to show how easy it can be to use the
*Strategy 5x5* as an enabling constraint to drive better strategic
thinking, especially for small working groups.

Let's say you are a department manager, and want to become more
strategic as you set goals and build a vision for your part of the
organization. You work with your staff and peers to set direction for
the year ahead. In this exercise, you feel like expectations are high.
You're supposed to anticipate the future, explore many options, and
settle on the "best" way forward. You've seen others be rewarded for
unwavering conviction in their choices, so you model after that.

But deep down, you know the truth is different. Uncertainty is high; the
future is unknowable. The organization you work within is a complex
adaptive system; change is more emergent than directed. And while strong
conviction can motivate strong execution, you need a way to accelerate
learning and be open to adapting your vision.

In the past, when you've done this, you tried to spark some good ideas,
then developed the first promising one into "strategic plans". You
supported the plan with 50 slides to make it bulletproof when you
communicated it across your teams and peers. You then sold it, with
certainty.

What if... you could drive strategic dialog with a working group in a
way that (1) makes focused choices while acknowledging the uncertainty,
(2) drives execution while recognizing the complexity, and (3) acts as a
living document to support adaptability?

Oh, and let's keep it simple. You don't really have time to learn heavy,
new ideas about strategy... you just need better ways to organize the
dialog. A starter kit, if you will.

So here we show offer three "local starters", derived from three great
thought leaders:

-   [V2MOM](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/how-to-create-alignment-within-your-company/?utm_source=blueprint.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=getting-started-exploring-possibilities)
    > (Marc Bienoff) - places focus on alignment, communication

-   [Decision
    > Stack](https://www.thedecisionstack.com/what-is-the-decision-stack/?utm_source=blueprint.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=getting-started-exploring-possibilities)
    > (Martin Eriksson) - places focus on focus

-   [Estuarine
    > Mapping](https://cynefin.io/wiki/Estuarine_framework?utm_source=blueprint.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=getting-started-exploring-possibilities)
    > (Dave Snowden) - places focus on change & complexity

Mid-level leaders should be able to jump into any of these with a low
cost-of-entry. Each of them can help support communications up and down
the existing lines of authority within your organization. And those
conversations, in turn, yield alignment.

V2MOM - Vision, Values, Methods, Obstacles, Measures

*Decision Framework:*

-   What do you want to achieve?

-   What\'s important to you?

-   How do you get it?

-   What is preventing you from being successful?

-   How do you know you have it?

![](media/image11.png){width="6.5in" height="4.041666666666667in"}

*Strategy 5×5 based on Salesforce's V2MOM*

This approach can be applied by department leaders, team leads, and even
individuals. Salesforce created this in their early days, to support
communication and alignment, as they scaled. As Marc Bienoff explains
it, they really emphasized the communication benefits:

*"I've always thought our biggest strength is how we've maintained
alignment while growing quickly. Success depends on constant
communication and complete alignment."*

He also pointed out how this kind of thinking differs from the normal
"day job" and how alignment involves convincing others (i.e. your boss,
your teams) that your choices are sound:

*"We need to be in the present moment and pay attention to where we are
and what's going on to help us deal with those smaller, less monumental
issues that dominate the bulk of our time. You have to convince others
to align with your vision to plot a course forward. You need to
prioritize. And at a big company, you need to scale the process of
setting priorities for tens or hundreds of thousands of employees. The
V2MOM enables me to clarify what I'm doing, and then communicate it
clearly to the entire company."*

So at Salesforce, each leader, and each individual (as part of their
employee performance management process, I'm guessing) will draft a
V2MOM as a living document.

If we move this exercise into a *Strategy 5x5*, we can make the full
possibility space more visible, exploring several different ideas for
vision, for values, for methods, key obstacles, and key measures. The
possibility space will present the full V2MOM, but the distinct
possibilities (i.e. combinations of options across the space), can help
set a path, say, for the upcoming quarter.

Connect the V2MOM *Strategy 5x5s* from each level in your organization,
to support transparency and alignment. Set expectations for revisiting
the canvas (e.g. at a cadence) to support cross-functional
communications and improve adaptability.

If you are just getting your feet wet with strategy, the V2MOM might be
a good place to start.

The Decision Stack

*Decision Framework:*

-   Where are we going?

-   How will we get there?

-   What matters right now on that journey?

-   What actions do we take to move forward?

-   How do we do the work?

![](media/image8.png){width="6.5in" height="4.041666666666667in"}

*Strategy 5×5 based on "The Decision Stack"*

This approach, from Martin Eriksson, has some similarities to the V2MOM,
but emphasizes the importance of communicating "what we are not
pursuing". In his "Decision Stack" visuals, he makes a point of showing
the options that are not being pursued (in blue) alongside the choices
that form the strategic direction (in yellow).

This is a powerful way to gain focus. By communicating that there are
several good options, but only one will get our attention and resources,
leaders can strengthen alignment across teams.

Eriksson says:

*"In a world of ever-growing complexity, where startups struggle to keep
everyone on the same page and scaleups struggle to move fast enough,
empowering small cross-functional teams with the autonomy to make
decisions themselves is the only way to succeed. Yet the thousands of
decisions made at every level by our teams still need direction. They
still need alignment. They still need context. Every decision is a
trade-off, and deciding what not to do is just as important as deciding
what to do."*

He recommends setting strategy from the top-down, and challenging
strategy from the bottom-up. His decision framework starts with options
for vision and current challenges, then takes an honest look at which
areas need focus to achieve the vision, or address the challenge. These
could be internal areas, or external areas for a business, like segments
of a market.

From there, he recommends exploring objectives (goals), opportunities
(work), and principles (ways) that can be put into service in the areas
of strategic focus. The possibilities that are identified across the
possibility space can then be expressed as hypotheses:

*We believe applying \<these principles\> while pursuing \<this
opportunity\> can achieve \<this objective \>in \<this strategic area\>
to realize \<this vision\>.*

Once a set of hypotheses are formed, the preferred direction (yellow vs.
blue) can be set and communicated.

He likes using [Teresa
Torres](https://www.producttalk.org/2023/12/opportunity-solution-trees/?utm_source=blueprint.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=getting-started-exploring-possibilities)'
*Opportunity Solution Trees* to drive execution in a way that can easily
connect back to the decisions that set the focus. This is an enabler of
effectiveness that complements the speed advantage of autonomous teams.
He explains:

*"As an industry, we have been responsible for a lot of useless work. We
have over-indexed on efficiency, delivery, and productivity, and not
paid enough attention to what we should build in the first place. This
mismatch compounds when we (rightly) start empowering our teams with
more and more autonomy -- they can all run faster, but are they running
in the right direction for the business? Are they even running in the
same direction?"*

Estuarine Mapping

*Decision Framework:*

-   For existing \'constraints\', where is change possible?

-   For existing \'constructors\', where is change possible?

-   For existing \'actors\', where is change possible?

-   What actions can/should we take on the \'actants\'?

-   What micro-projects could we initiate?

![](media/image1.png){width="6.5in" height="4.041666666666667in"}

*Strategy 5×5 based on Estuarine Mapping*

This approach, from Dave Snowden and the Cynefin Company, introduces
some new vocabulary from complexity theory, but frames a simple,
pragmatic approach to driving change in organizations.

Similar to the way that a Wardley Map served as a prerequisite to the
*Strategy 5x5* dialog, we build an Estuarine Map in advance of the
strategic dialog in this approach, too.

Here's an oversimplified summary:

1.  Identify the "manageable items" in your system of work (e.g.
    > rituals, policies, roles, etc.)

2.  Evaluate the relative "energy cost to change" and "time to change"
    > for each item (i.e. how entrenched or entwined is this item, in
    > your complex adaptive organization?)

3.  Find the items where change is possible (i.e. that offer lower
    > costs/time to change...but not too low!)

4.  Initiate nudges (as micro-projects) to probe via small changes to
    > the items.

Note how this is the polar opposite of defining a future state, and
constructing a big project or transformation to get there, from the
current state.

Let's dig a little deeper into the unique vocabulary that Snowden uses
(but if you're still wondering about "estuarine", then you'll have to
find your answers
[here](https://thecynefin.co/estuarine-mapping/?utm_source=blueprint.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=getting-started-exploring-possibilities)).

-   Actants - anyone or anything who is acting in the system
    > ("manageable items")

To build a list of *actants* (to plot in our map), we explore three
kinds:

-   Constraints - anything that shapes and influences a system,
    > affecting patterns and possibilities in it. Examples include an
    > organization's policies, structure, and norms. (Think: Conway's
    > Law.)

-   Constructors - elements that produce consistent, replicable,
    > reliable transformations through various mechanisms. Examples
    > include: rituals, processes, habits, roles, artifacts, rules, etc.
    > (Think: ways of working)

-   Actors - anyone or anything who can act with intelligence and
    > intention. Examples include: individuals, roles, teams. (Think:
    > org structure and leadership structure)

These should zero in on the things that are "keeping you up at night,"
as leaders. Since they are "manageable", you know something can be done
(something should be done!), but also know that the line from
change-to-outcome is non-deterministic.

So with this set of items, rated by the energy required to induce a
change, you can begin to plot a "direction of travel", for a journey of
change. Not a desired destination, but the first steps in the path.
\[Notice how different this is from a goal-setting process like OKRs.\]

The strategy that forms (from Estuarine Mapping) is a set of
possibilities, in the form of micro-projects, that target lower-energy
items where change might unlock desirable emergent outcomes. We don't
know (can't know), so we run it as an experiment.

Setting this desired "direction of travel" can help unleash autonomous
teams to run their own experiments, in their local context, in the same
direction, yielding aligned experimentation.

The system will evolve and change with the first micro-project, so
monitoring the results and updating the map is a continuous activity.
The map is a living document, and should evolve with your evolving
system of work.

So this wraps up our four-part series on the *Strategy 5x5* facilitation
canvas. Hopefully, today's examples convince you that introducing them
into your leadership team doesn't require a dramatic change to your
current practice. I bet you do something like a V2MOM (or Decision
Stack) already today.

Also note that you can "roll your own" decision framework, and form a
customized possibility space, better suited for your current context.
Start small and simple, to match your current practice, and build from
there.

Your journey to greater strategic capability can be framed with the
*Strategy 5x5*. Just grow your capability by swapping in new decision
frameworks when you're ready for (or in need of) new approaches.
