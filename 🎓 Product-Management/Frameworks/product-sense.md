## What exactly is product sense? 🤔

**Product sense is the skill of consistently being able to craft
products (or make changes to existing products) that have the intended
impact on their users.** Product sense relies on (1) **empathy** to
discover meaningful user needs and (2) **creativity** to come up with
solutions that effectively address those needs.

![](media/image22.jpg){width="6.5in" height="4.708333333333333in"}

You likely have good product sense if you've championed successful
features or products that were not obvious to others. Here are some
examples of products born out of strong product sense:

-   The original iPhone was built on the insight that people value
     aesthetics, and not just functionality, in their products. It was
     designed around the idea that consumers needed a smartphone that
     felt personal.

-   The original Gmail responded to unmet user needs at the time. It
     addressed common user problems, including low storage quotas, poor
     search experience, and related messages separated from each other
     (instead of being combined in a thread).

-   Superhuman saw a need for a modern email client to allow busy
     professionals to get through emails quickly. It used thoughtful
     design to support fast email workflows and limit distractions.

Each of these products originated with strong product sense and offered
creative solutions to previously unmet user needs.

### Building product sense

I was the first PM on Slack's growth team, where I spent more than four
years building product experiences used by millions of people. I'm now a
product leader at YouTube, where I'm building a yet-to-be-released
zero-to-one product.

In my roles, I've relied on product sense to bring unique insights to
the table and drive user value and business impact. In this article, I
will be discussing four practices for building product sense.

**Building empathy:**

1.  Observe people interacting with products

2.  Deconstruct everyday products

**Improving creativity:**

3.  Learn from great product thinkers

4.  Be curious about changes in technology and your domain

Let's get to it.

### **1. Observe people interacting with products 🕵🏾**

One approach to developing empathy---and thus, product sense---is to
repeatedly observe people using products, whether yours or other
companies'. This practice will help you get better at identifying subtle
user needs that others miss (e.g. social, emotional, or functional
needs).

You can start small. Initially, I recommend doing this two to four times
a month for your product. Don't just read reports from researchers on
your team; instead attend user research sessions to get firsthand
exposure to user experiences and reactions. What's important is to pay
attention to micro details and ask yourself why people react to your
product the way they do. Observe their facial expressions as they try
various aspects of your product, and try to spot moments when they're
hesitant, confused, excited, etc. In those moments, ask open-ended
questions to better understand not just how they feel but, more
importantly, *why*.

Here are some sample questions you can ask:

1.  What do you think the purpose of this product is? Who do you think
     it's for? *This will give you a sense of how effective your
     product's landing page is. It also gives you ideas for words to
     describe your product that resonate with people.*

2.  Now that you're in the product, what actions do you want to take?
     *This will help you understand which features are easy to discover
     and how clear your product's navigation and calls to action are.*

3.  What are you thinking right now? How does that make you feel? *I
     tend to ask this at every new step the user lands on, because
     people tend not to notice their self-talk and feelings otherwise.*

When I joined Slack in 2016, our data indicated high churn rates for new
users on mobile. We wanted to understand why, so we set up user research
sessions and asked questions such as the ones above. Through those
questions and through observing users, we learned that:

-   Many people didn't really understand what Slack did, even after
     visiting our homepage, which was too abstract at the time.

-   People would land in the Slack app and not know what to do because
     of competing calls to action.

-   People didn't want to give permission to their mobile address book,
     because it had their friends' contact info and not their
     colleagues'.

These new insights led us to come up with experiment ideas that enabled
us to improve Slack's product experience for new users and significantly
increase the product's retention rate. Below is one such experiment,
which removed friction in the invite step and addressed users' concerns
around giving permission to their address books.

![](media/image21.jpg){width="6.5in" height="4.708333333333333in"}

After observing hundreds of people use products I've worked on (whether
in research sessions or coffee shops etc.) and asking them questions
about their usage, I've developed better instincts about how people will
react to various product experiences. Here are five quick lessons about
product usage that have stuck with me:

1.  **People are time-crunched and distracted when they use your
     product.** They might not read labels or text and might not be
     willing to spend even a few seconds to figure out what to do next.
     Pick the right defaults and use visual design and cues to make
     primary actions obvious (e.g. prominence, lack of distractions).

2.  **People will drop out of a product flow as soon as they feel
     confused or nervous** that they might be doing something wrong.
     Make sure labels are unambiguous and contrast options
     appropriately.

3.  **Don't give people too much information at once**, because once
     they feel overwhelmed, they tend to leave. For example, we ran
     pricing page experiments at Slack and saw increases in purchases
     when we moved some of the information on the various purchase
     options behind a dropdown list.

4.  **Context impacts decisions.** Use tools like comparisons,
     contrasting, and social proof to make it easier for users to make
     a decision.

5.  **Make sure the goal of your product and possible actions are clear
     to users.** At Slack, we often heard from users that they didn't
     know what Slack was really about and what they could do with the
     app. We experimented with various onboarding experiences to
     address that issue, and one early experiment on mobile increased
     user retention just by telling new users what Slack is and linking
     to a video showing people how a work team might use it on desktop
     and mobile.

The more frequently and closely you watch people using products, the
more observant you'll become and the more empathy you'll develop.

### **2. Deconstruct everyday products 👨🏾‍🔧️**

Another approach to developing empathy is to observe *yourself* using
everyday products. I spend one or two hours a month trying out new
products and deconstructing them. The goal is to strengthen my intuition
about why some products work well and others don't---this also helps me
identify common UX best practices and paradigms. While deconstructing
products, I recommend asking the types of questions Julie Zhuo shares in
the article [[How to Do a Product
Critique]{.underline}](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/how-to-do-a-product-critique-98b657050638#.v5o81mocz),
such as:

1.  What's the experience of getting started or signing up?

2.  How does this app explain itself in the first minute?

3.  How easy to use was the app?

4.  How did you feel while exploring the app?

5.  Did the app deliver on your expectations?

If you want to go deeper in your understanding of a product, I recommend
also looking at other products in the same category and comparing and
contrasting them. For example, to better understand a product like
[[Cash App]{.underline}](https://cash.app/), compare it with
[[Venmo]{.underline}](https://venmo.com/). You'll see that these two
seemingly similar money apps are fundamentally different. Below are a
few dimensions you can look at to compare two products and better
understand how they approach product decisions.

![](media/image17.jpg){width="6.5in" height="3.6666666666666665in"}

![](media/image20.jpg){width="6.5in" height="3.2777777777777777in"}

![](media/image13.jpg){width="6.5in" height="3.875in"}

By comparing a product with others in the space, some of the product
design choices become more salient and it's easier to get hints of the
product's strategy. For example, in the Cash App vs. Venmo comparison,
it seems Venmo's strategy is to lean into its social graph (use Venmo
because your friends are already on it and you can easily make sure
you're sending the money to the right person), whereas Cash App is
focused on ease of use and breadth of capabilities for people who want
to go beyond just peer-to-peer transfers (run your personal finances or
small business from your phone).

When I use new products, I also observe my own self-talk and feelings,
including moments of frustration, such as:

-   I'm trying to log in to my medical app to set up an appointment, but
     I'm unable to because I can't remember my password. The password
     reset flow never sent me an email, even after multiple attempts,
     and I just stopped using the service.

-   I'm trying to rent a car, but as soon as I input the start time, the
     interface shows an error message telling me that the end time
     can't be before the start time. I was going to update the end time
     anyway, and now I feel stupid and frustrated while using this
     product, which is not a feeling you want your users to have.

I also note moments when I experience delight, such as:

-   Carta's stock-vesting email could have been just text letting me
     know that I've vested into more shares, but it also includes an
     animation with confetti that takes my feeling of celebration to
     another level.

-   Google Photos collages combine multiple photos of the people who
     matter to me the most in delightful ways.

![](media/image11.jpg){width="3.4444444444444446in"
height="7.097222222222222in"}

One bonus practice I recommend for improving your empathy and
observation skills is meditation. I've been meditating for years, and
it's helped me become more perceptive---not just of other people's
feelings but also of my own. If you are new to meditation, I recommend
starting with an
[[app]{.underline}](https://www.fitmind.co/fitmind-meditation-app) or
joining a [[meditation
community]{.underline}](https://sundaysangha.net/) to help you form a
daily habit.

​​The more frequently and closely you observe people (and yourself), the
more insight you will gain into their motivations and needs, and the
more your empathy will grow.

### **3. Learn from great product thinkers 📓**

One of the biggest levers for developing creativity (and again, product
sense) is to spend time with people who already have it.

My creativity improved significantly after I joined Slack, partly
because I observed how people like CEO Stewart Butterfield approached
building products. If you've never worked at a company with strong
product thinkers, I recommend joining such a company at some point in
your career to strengthen your product fundamentals---the earlier, the
better. If you're not sure which companies to consider, start by
thinking of companies whose products you use and love.

Once you're at a company with great product thinkers, I recommend
attending as many product reviews as you can. Take copious notes during
the reviews, and look for patterns in the questions and feedback you
hear---i.e. what type of comments keep coming up. Over time, you'll
understand the mental checklists your product leaders use to ensure that
new product ideas will be successful, and you'll identify the principles
they use to make product decisions and trade-offs.

One of the things I learned from my exposure to Stewart Butterfield is
that *every* detail about the user experience matters. "The details are
not the details," he would say, quoting designer Charles Eames. "They
make the design." Stewart's obsession with the details is one of the
main reasons why Slack exists and is used by millions of people.

For example, if a user tries to use \@channel to message a large number
of teammates across multiple time zones in Slack, they'll see a cartoon
rooster (below) asking them to think twice about notifying these people.
It's a detail that wasn't built to move metrics but rather to prevent
anxiety for people who would otherwise receive work notifications at odd
hours. The rooster icon was chosen to keep the tone playful so that the
message sender doesn't feel ashamed or guilty when they read the
warning.

![](media/image9.jpg){width="2.861111111111111in"
height="6.611111111111111in"}

This type of product detail can mean a lot to users. When I would review
customer tickets at Slack, many of them were positive feedback from
people thanking us for the thoughtfulness that the team put into the
product. Sometimes people couldn't even say exactly *why* they loved
Slack---partly because what drew them wasn't one big feature, but rather
the attention to details across the product. I've learned that if you
remove from your product lots of small annoyances that people deal with
on a daily basis, the value you get from doing that adds up to something
meaningful.

Another lesson I learned from Stewart is to spend time understanding
user problems and framing them in a way that sets strong constraints for
the team. Many PMs jump into solution-finding before they truly
understand the problem. This leads to ineffective solutions, or
indecisiveness as their teams struggle to eliminate potential solutions.
If you understand why a problem exists and frame it clearly, you will
identify enough constraints that only a few solutions will be left,
streamlining the decision-making process. For example, in the article
[[Are You Solving the Right
Problems?]{.underline}](https://hbr.org/2017/01/are-you-solving-the-right-problems),
Thomas Wedell-Wedellsborg gives an example of how two different framings
of a problem lead to completely different solutions:

![](media/image7.jpg){width="6.5in" height="2.8333333333333335in"}

This ability to reframe problems and set opinionated constraints is a
key skill I've seen product thinkers use to drive creative solutions.

If, on the other hand, you don't work at a company with strong product
thinkers, look for external mentors and read articles or interviews from
people such as [[Julie
Zhuo]{.underline}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b78zq-kimVs),
[[Stewart
Butterfield]{.underline}](https://medium.com/@stewart/we-dont-sell-saddles-here-4c59524d650d),
[[David
Lieb]{.underline}](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/5f-on-starting-and-scaling-one-of-the-biggest-ios-apps),
and [[Rahul
Vohra]{.underline}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaxAdRlyZQ8).

If you're able to connect with great product thinkers, here are some
sample questions you can ask to better understand their processes and
insights:

-   What prompted you to build your product? *This will give you a sense
     of the type of user insights you should be looking for and the
     process to get them.*

-   What were the key decision points along the way?

-   What alternative approaches did you consider? *For ambiguous
     problems, you have to explore multiple approaches before you land
     on one that works. Understanding the solutions that were
     discarded, and why, will help you get a sense of how they test
     hypotheses and make trade-offs.*

-   What were surprising insights or results? *Knowing when their
     initial hypotheses were wrong and understanding why can help you
     uncover great insights.*

-   What principles or frameworks helped you navigate the ambiguity?
     *Great product thinkers internalize product principles they use to
     evaluate solutions. If you can uncover those principles, you can
     use them to guide your decisions as well.*

Gaining access to strong product thinkers may be difficult, but try to
read as many blog posts or watch as many videos as you can where product
leaders who you look up to share their thought processes.

### **4. Be curious about changes in technology and your domain📱**

Another practice for developing creativity is to spend time learning
about emerging trends in technology, society, and regulations. Changes
in the industry create opportunities for launching new products that can
address user needs in new ways. As a PM, you want to understand what's
possible in your domain in order to come up with creative solutions. For
example:

-   Cash App decided to support Bitcoin transactions, and as a result,
     76% (nearly \$4.6 billion) of its 2020 revenues came from Bitcoin.
     For more examples of products that benefited from new trends, see
     Lenny's article [[Why
     now]{.underline}](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/why-now?).

-   Uber became possible because of the proliferation of smartphones
     with GPS capabilities and the availability of Google Maps APIs.

-   Clubhouse took off quickly because of the pandemic, which
     accelerated the need for virtual public discourse.

There are two levels at which you can look at emerging trends: the macro
and the micro. At the macro level, you should keep track of important
platform shifts (e.g. web3, AR/VR, AI), social shifts (e.g. the shift to
remote work), and changes in regulations (e.g. new privacy protection
laws). It's important to keep an open mind about new technologies,
because at first they receive a lot of skepticism and have obvious
flaws. I still remember when people were skeptical of e-commerce and
assumed it would never be safe to use credit cards online. When you see
a new trend, instead of dismissing it as a fad, ask yourself, "If this
trend reaches its full potential, what opportunities will it create that
I can pursue?"

There are many places to keep up with macro technology trends. For
example, you can:

-   Watch annual developer conferences from major tech companies to
     understand what areas they see as promising (e.g.
     [[Google]{.underline}](https://io.google/2021/?lng=en),
     [[Apple]{.underline}](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/),
     [[Meta]{.underline}](https://developers.facebook.com/f8/),
     [[Amazon]{.underline}](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/)).

-   Read commentary from industry analysts (e.g. [[Ben
     Thompson]{.underline}](https://stratechery.com/)).

-   Follow tech founders and investors on Twitter (e.g. [[Naval
     Ravikant]{.underline}](https://twitter.com/naval?), [[Elad
     Gil]{.underline}](https://twitter.com/eladgil?), [[Balaji
     Srinivasan]{.underline}](https://twitter.com/balajis)) and pay
     attention to trends they're bullish on.

-   Invest in or advise startups operating in spaces that interest you.
     If that's not possible, pay attention to what companies top VCs
     are investing in, and follow those companies.

While the macro trends are helpful in seeing where the industry is
going, many of the non-obvious opportunities lie in deeply understanding
micro changes that may unlock new possibilities. For example, Figma's
high-quality browser-based application for designers became possible
only once WebGL became performant enough. In order to understand the
nuances of micro changes, I recommend meeting with engineers and domain
experts and going deep with them on topics of interest, such as new APIs
or platform capabilities.

As Paul Graham said in [[How to Get Startup
Ideas]{.underline}](http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html), "Live in
the future, then build what's missing." Living in the future is also an
effective approach to developing your product sense.

### How to tell if you're getting better at product sense 📈

Developing product sense takes time and practice. As you get better at
it, you'll:

-   Notice subtle things about products and people that you would have
     missed before (e.g. micro frustrations and delights)

-   Anticipate non-obvious user problems when you look at product
     experiences or before you present at product reviews

-   Develop higher-quality hypotheses about product experiences to
     build, even in the face of ambiguity

-   Contribute more unique insights to your team, given your improved
     understanding of users and the landscape

-   Be right more often than not about what impact a change to a flow
     has on metrics

-   And, potentially, receive comments from your design partner on how
     impressed they are with a detail you noticed

I hope you decide to invest in developing your product sense, and that
the practices in this article, on strengthening empathy and creativity,
are as useful to you as they've been to me.

## Product Sense Demystified

Even though I have been writing consistently about product now for more
than two decades, including a few books, I have thus far managed to
avoid using the term "product sense."

That was not an accident. I have always disliked the term, and I
especially dislike the implications.

But for whatever reason, a lot more people are using the term now, and
I'm hearing it come up too often as the excuse I was worried about.
Either, "Trust me because I have great product sense," or "I could never
be a successful product person because my manager says I don't have good
product sense."

To be fair, several serious product thinkers have been trying to clarify
that despite the term, "product sense" is not something you are born
with, it is a skill that you develop.

But from what I can tell, these people are getting drowned out by the
countless people that take the term too literally.

For most people, the word "sense" implies that it is innate. As in, some
people have a strong sense of smell, and others have strong product
sense.

But what's really going on is something very different.

I argue that strong product sense is better described as deep product
knowledge, and is the result of truly immersing yourself into a specific
product space.

You build strong product sense by spending serious quality time with
customers, analyzing the competitive landscape, immersing yourself in
the product data, and consuming everything you can about the industry,
and the enabling technologies.

Your mind assimilates the learnings from all of these sources, and
eventually, if you've been putting in the effort and paying attention,
you have a very solid foundation in your product space, and you are able
to not only understand the behaviors you are seeing, but you can also
predict what's likely to happen going forward.

Now you may think that someone with years of experience in the specific
domain might have a real advantage in developing this product sense, but
in most cases this turns out not to be true. A disproportionate amount
of innovation comes from people that don't bring the baggage of the
domain -- they bring fresh perspective and the willingness to question
dogma.

I have "gone deep" into several different product spaces over my career.
But the space I went deepest on, and a space I still love, is the
software tools space. I've built several software tool products, and
also was CTO of a software tool startup, and during these years, I was
truly immersed in the space.

I personally visited with literally hundreds of product teams to
understand the challenges they faced and the tools they used. I spent
countless hours pouring through data. I personally tested out every
software tool I could find. I established relationships with many of the
key thought leaders in the space. I followed the software tool industry
and trends. I met regularly with the industry analysts. I spoke at the
industry conferences.

I did all this first as an engineer, then as a product manager, and
later as a product leader.

But the result was that I was able to see 5-10 years down the road with
considerable accuracy, not because of any innate sense, but because of
all the time and effort I had put in.

And everyone I know that has clearly demonstrated this strong product
sense has likewise put in the effort -- even if they don't realize it
was that effort that's responsible for their strong product sense.

But the good news here is that you can absolutely develop your product
sense. While I avoid the product sense term, I do say very often to
people I coach that "there is no substitute for doing the homework."

If you're a product leader or a company founder, this is simply
non-negotiable.

If you're a product manager, this is often one of the most meaningful
differences between an entry level product manager, and the more senior
levels (e.g. senior product manager, group product manager, principal
product manager).

One important caveat when it comes to product sense:

Some people think that because they have gone deep in one space, and had
some level of success there, then their product sense will also be
accurate for other spaces. This happens when the person doesn't realize
the true source of product sense, and instead they think they have some
sort of mental gift, but this is just arrogance, not product sense.

And hopefully nobody thinks good product sense is a substitute for
testing your product ideas. Product sense can definitely accelerate
product discovery, but it's more like having a compass as you navigate
the product risks.

While I might wish people would just stop using the term "product
sense," and instead talk about gaining deep product knowledge, I've been
around long enough to know that's unlikely to happen.

But hopefully more people will realize product sense is absolutely
something they can and should develop, and ultimately we'll see more
product teams building products based on this deeper understanding.

## Is Product Art or Science?

One question that has come up since the beginning of tech-powered
product creation, is whether creating products is fundamentally art or
science?

In my mind there was never really a question that it has always been a
blend of both.

There can be real art and beauty in the engineering, real art and beauty
in the design, and real art and beauty in the solutions we build, and
this beauty can contribute to the value and desirability of our
products.

In some products, especially consumer products and consumer devices, art
plays a somewhat larger role.

But most of us focus on the science; we start with problems to solve, we
have ideas (hypotheses) about what might work, we prototype, we test
those prototypes for value, usability, viability, and feasibility, and
we iterate until we have enough evidence we're convinced something is
worth building, then we build, test for quality and performance, and
push our product out into the world.

I've held this general view for my entire professional life. But I
realize now that my view was heavily biased due to my education and
training in the science side of things, and my very real ignorance of
the art side.

As with so many things, I had assumptions about art and artists, most of
which I never even questioned, and beyond that, I didn't even know what
I didn't know.

Until last week, when I read a new book that truly opened my eyes to the
world of art and artists, and surprisingly, gave me a much deeper
understanding of how we create great products.

The book is The Creative Act: A Way of Being, by Rick Rubin, the 9-time
GRAMMY-winning record producer.

The book has generated a lot of interest in the broader community, and
quickly rose to the top of the bestseller lists. But I really haven't
heard it discussed much in the product space. In my experience, a book
like this comes along once every 5-10 years or so, and I would strongly
encourage my product, design and engineering friends to give this a
read.

Many of you are probably much like me; I very much appreciate and enjoy
art -- music, paintings, dance, fiction, architecture -- but I would
never have suggested that I had any of the skills or talents necessary
to create these types of art. Further, I had no real idea how the
various types of artists think about and create their work.

In this article I'd like to share how this book has changed and expanded
how I view our work in product.

But first, I've learned that there are some people in the product
community that will grasp at any opportunity to view themselves as some
sort of demi-god, so for those people, let me be clear right now I'm not
suggesting that you should view yourself as some sort of fine artist,
hired to express your unique self through your products.

Instead, I'm talking to those of us that are product creators, such as
the engineers, product designers, and product managers on empowered
product teams working to solve problems for our customers in ways our
customers love, yet work for our business.

One of the biggest surprises in the book was the language the author
used to talk about how art is inspired, discovered and crafted. He
literally frames the creative work as "problems to solve," which of
course we've used for many years in the product world, but was very much
unexpected in this context. He goes on to describe the role of
"discovery,"1 which he describes as a series of experiments exploring as
many ideas as possible, and then the "craft" of fleshing out the work
into its final form.

But there are literally hundreds of examples in the book where I
realized that the world of art and the world of product are much more
alike than I had ever imagined.

Remarkably, I consider about 70-80% of the book as very relevant to
those of us that create products. I had no expectations that this would
be the case, so this was just a happy surprise.

This is because the author views artists fundamentally as creators,2 and
as such, most of us are very capable of creation, and of course product
teams are very much creators.

The biggest difference is that artists are creating primarily as a means
of self-expression, and we are creating in order to deliver value.

But it's much easier for me to see now how certain companies (Apple is
the most obvious example) work very hard to express in their products
the values of the founder.

I decided to read this book because I wanted to learn more about how
artists create art. I ended up learning a great deal about how people
create meaningful work.

The use of the term "discovery" was again a surprise, but it is
consistent with Ed Catmull's book Creativity Inc. describing Pixar's
process for creating animated feature films for children.

↩︎

The author uses the terms "creators" and "makers" throughout. ↩︎

## Defining Good

I consistently get asked questions like the following: "Just look at
Facebook/Amazon/Google (usually one of those three). Don't you think
they have a terrible product? How could they possibly be so successful?"

No matter how many times I hear the question, I always have to take a
breath before I answer.

I think there are three relatively minor confusions underlying this
question, and two very large confusions. But they all get to the heart
of what makes great products and great product people. So in that
spirit, I thought I'd share my answer here.

First the minor issues:

1\. Product people often fall into the trap of confusing themselves with
the actual target customers. Just because you or I don't like something
doesn't actually mean much, if we're not the target audience.

2\. Very often these backseat designers are pointing to secondary tasks
that frankly don't really matter. Good product managers and designers
know that there are a few critical tasks in every product that need to
be exceptionally good, and if this comes at the expense of some
secondary tasks, that can be a very good trade to make.

3\. Anyone that has been working in this industry for a while, and has
actually been running A/B tests, knows that we're very often surprised.
What we think would happen with a given design or feature doesn't always
work out like that. Unless you have access to the detailed analytics,
it's very possible your intuition is wrong. Mine is wrong so often I
have come to expect to be wrong. But I've found that helps me much more
than it hurts me because I've learned to be very open to the data and to
learn quickly.

Now the big issues:

1\. How do you actually define good? If you define it by what you
personally like, then maybe these sites are not very good. But I define
good using the product scorecard. The prioritized set of business KPI's
that the business is looking to the product team to find ways to
positively influence.

If you define goodness in a social network as the ability to rapidly
grow and deeply engage users, its hard to argue that Facebook has been
anything less than off-the-charts successful.

If you define goodness in an e-commerce site as KPI's such as conversion
rate, average shopping cart value, customer acquisition cost, and repeat
use, then it's hard to argue that Amazon has been anything less than
stellar.

If you define goodness in a search engine as the number of search
results (organic or paid) that the user needs to evaluate before he
finds what he is looking for, then it's hard to argue that Google hasn't
done an outstanding job.

2\. Even when teams focus on the key KPI's for their product, they still
often can't see the forest through the trees. What I mean by that is
that too many people focus on what's right in front of them, which is
typically usability issues. I'm a huge advocate for removing friction
cause by poor design, however, I also know that it's mostly about value.
If you focus on providing real and sustained value, that will overcome a
lot of sins. If you don't provide that value, I really don't care how
usable the product is.

The companies I highlighted above provide a ton of value to their users
and customers. Sustained value.

All of them make mistakes. All of them work to improve their product
every day. But mostly they focus on providing real value to their
customers and driving the key KPI's of their business.

That's how I define good, and I'm hoping that's how you define it as
well.

## Great Products By Design

I do not believe great products happen by accident. In every case,
behind every great product I find that there are certain truths. Today I
want to share ten such truths. I try to keep these in mind on every
product effort:

1\. Engineering is important, but user experience design is more
important, and usually more difficult

2\. Engineers are typically terrible user experience designers;
engineers think in terms of implementation models, but users think in
terms of conceptual models

3\. User Experience design means both interaction design and visual
design

4\. Functionality (product requirements) and user experience design are
inherently intertwined

5\. Product ideas must be tested -- early and often -- on actual target
users in order to come up with a good user experience

6\. We need to test (validate) usability, desirability and feasibility
-- before proceeding to engineering

7\. We need a high-fidelity prototype, so we can quickly, easily and
frequently test ideas on real users with a realistic user experience

8\. The high-fidelity prototype is the most effective way to communicate
the required user experience with the full product team

9\. The job of the product manager is to identify the minimal possible
product that meets the objectives and provides the desired user
experience -- minimizing time to market, user and implementation
complexity

10\. Once the minimal successful product has been designed and
validated, it is not something that can be piecemealed and expect the
same results

You can expect much more in the coming months along these lines. I
continue to talk to too many product teams that are stuck in old, failed
ways of creating products, and life is too short for bad products.

## The Best Product Management Model?

One question I get quite frequently is "Google is making boatloads of
money, so how can we do product management like Google?" Or another
common variant is "Apple creates fantastic products. How can we do
product management like Apple?"

You can understand why some might look at Google or Apple and think they
should just clone what they do. But odds are they'd be making a big
mistake.

Don't get me wrong. While Apple and Google have very different models of
product management, on the whole I'd argue they're right for their
companies (at least as long as their founders continue to stay so deeply
involved in product).

But I have yet to recommend Google's model of product management to
other companies. And in the case of Apple, to implement their model
you'd have to clone Steve Jobs.

The product management model for Google is very different, and I argue
it needs to be, and the same is true for Apple.

While there are a set of skills that are important for all tech product
managers -- skills like assessing opportunities, defining product
principles, product discovery, and prototype testing -- there's more to
succeeding in an organization than just the skills involved.

It's much like a sports team. Yes the skills are critically important.
If you can't catch a ball, you won't go far as a receiver. However,
winning requires more than skills. It requires having a game plan or
strategy for winning, working well as a member of a team, adapting to
your opponent, the playing field, and the conditions.

Similarly, building a successful product management organization
requires not only developing the skills of your product managers, but
making sure they know how to work effectively with the rest of the
product team, as a key part of your company's overall product
development organization and product development process, and knowing
how to create the type of products your company requires, and knowing
how to compete successfully in the markets you play in.

When I talk with a company about the "best" product management model for
them, I'm looking at several factors, including:

-- The Type of Product. It matters whether you're producing a consumer
internet service, a consumer electronics device, enterprise software, or
a small business services. There are unique challenges of each and the
model should suit the needs.

-- The Product Development Process. For example, if the product
development team is using Scrum there are very specific demands on the
product managers and designers. Understanding the product development
process is essential. Every process has limitations and the "best"
product management model will proactively attack these limitations.

-- The Role of Product Management. In many companies the roles and
responsibilities are sliced up differently and the "best" product
management model is one where the staff has the ability and the desire
to serve the role that's needed. This also applies to the other key
related roles such as interaction designers and engineers, founders and
executives.

-- The Size of the Organization. A 12-person venture-funded startup with
a very involved product-oriented founder, has very different needs than
a 4000-employee public company with a large base of existing customers.

-- The Company Culture. Sometimes this is in fact the dominant factor.
For example, if you have a company where one or two people effectively
make all the product decisions that matter (and want to continue doing
so), then you want a product management model that facilitates this,
rather than fights it.

Apple, Google, Microsoft, eBay, and Yahoo all have different product
management models, and I argue they should. Could each be improved?
Certainly. Could you learn things from each of them? Absolutely. But you
won't improve by trying to force-fit a model from one company into
another.

Unless a company has made the decision that they want to try to change
their culture, I instead typically focus on getting the company to
embrace the strengths of their culture or process, and make sure the
product management model they select is proactive in addressing the
weaknesses.

## Product Management Models Part 2

In a recent article (The Best Product Management Model) I discussed the
notion that there is no single best product management model, and that
the most effective model for a given company depends on a wide range of
factors. I received several comments from people asking me to explain
more about these factors and their consequences. To cover this I'm going
to need a series of several articles, but I thought I'd start with the
factors that are most often driving the need for improvement in the
first place.

When I typically begin working with a company to help them develop the
skills of their product organization, and the techniques to help them
become more effective at producing successful products, I begin by
asking about the specific challenges they face.

Here's a list of the top 10 most frequent complaints I find at high-tech
companies:

1\. Wasted Release Cycles. Probably the single most common frustration
that senior management (as well as engineering) has is the feeling that
they all work hard but at the end of the year they have little to show
for it. They may be Agile and may have released a boatload of new
features, but they have very little in terms of results to show for it.
More generally, there is the feeling that many releases, often a
majority of releases, are wasted cycles in that they fails to meet their
objectives. Sometimes things even get worse.

2\. Time to Market. Right behind wasted release cycles is the belief
that it takes far too long to get from initial concept to successful
product. Not simply the time for a release, but rather the total time
including however many follow-on releases are necessary to get the
product to the point that

it accomplishes what it was originally supposed to do. Even with Scrum
teams, they might have an average of 3 or 4 sprints per release, but
they

find they need at least three releases to start making any money. All
told it's easy to see how "time to money" can easily be measured in
years and not months.

3\. Lack of Innovation. Especially in larger companies, but even in
startups that hit the year-mark, there is often a feeling that the
company has somehow lost the ability to innovate. Yes, they had some
great early innovation, but then things seemed to get much harder, and
everything that's done feels like it's at the margin and not really
making an impact, even though the staff is larger than ever.

4\. Unhappy Customers. Few consumer-facing companies survive long with
unhappy customers (there's a self-correcting mechanism built right in),
but for many business software companies, they can continue for quite
some time with unhappy customers, especially since switching costs are
often very high, combined with the fact that often the people that make
the purchase decision have little to do with those that use and depend
on the product. But companies with serious customer satisfaction issues
are no fun for anyone.

5\. Replicating Success. Many companies out there had one good product
at their start, and then struggle for years to replicate that success.
The best they can do is refine the original product, but eventually all
product cycles play out, and management becomes increasingly concerned
about the lack of future revenue streams.

6\. Handling Growth. A good problem to have, but one that's very
difficult nevertheless, is when your company grows very rapidly, and
what worked for you before no longer scales. Managing through rapid
growth is a very real challenge for successful companies, and everyone
knows the stories of companies that wasted away fantastic opportunities
by not effectively adapting to the new demands.

7\. Specials. In many companies, especially large enterprise companies,
they get seduced by the promise of a big customer in exchange for
"special" features. It only takes a few of these before the organization
is so bogged down with customer-specific requirements that even the
smallest changes take a long time, and then on top of that they can't
seem to get companies to buy the "standard" product.

8\. Decision Making. In far too many organizations the decision making
process is broken. The product team can't get decisions made in a timely
manner, and when they are made, they don't stick long enough to get a
product shipped. A very related complaint is churn, which is when
requirements change so frequently during development that it's very hard
to make forward progress.

9\. Role Confusion. In many companies, there is no clarity around who
"owns" the product, and who is responsible for each type of decision,
and lack of understanding of the purpose of certain roles. The result is
that there's no real sense of ownership or accountability.

10\. Employee Morale. Finally, I'll often get called into product
organizations because of low employee morale. The company isn't able to
retain their best product people and nobody's happy about that. Of
course this is just a symptom and is likely the result of several of the
items above, or other factors such as role definition, or very often
company culture.

Now each of these is a symptom of underlying problems in how the company
produces products. While there are specific techniques that can be used
to help some of these, the most effective product management model is
the one that will not only address the symptoms but work to
institutionalize the appropriate behaviors and processes.

More about additional factors in upcoming articles, but if you recognize
any of these symptoms you might want to take a hard look at how you
create software and ask yourself if how you handle product management
may have anything to do with it.

## Product Sense: What is it, Why it's Needed, and How to Keep it Fresh

 Acquiring product sense takes time and is never complete. It calls for
 blending your unique experiences with customer empathy and creative
 problem solving.

 I was recently asked, how do you grow product sense? While many
 articles highlight its importance, the journey to developing it often
 seems shrouded in mystery.

 To answer this question, I'll take a step back and begin with what is
 product sense? Then dive into, how do you get it? Is it necessary or a
 nice to have? And close with, does product sense go stale over time?

 Given the almost mythical nature of product sense, some warning
 verbiage might be needed... The views, thoughts, and opinions that
 follow are my own, they do not necessarily represent those of my
 friends, family, pets, communities, or other galaxies far, far, away.

 ![](media/image6.jpg){width="6.5in" height="5.527777777777778in"}

### What is product sense

 At a high level, product sense is understanding what makes for a
 high-quality product for your customers (empathy) and having strong,
 validated opinions about what solutions will be successful
 (creativity). For example, being able to proactively (1) identify
 important customer problems to solve in support of company goals and
 (2) build a compelling strategy to address those problems.

 ![](media/image5.jpg){width="6.5in" height="4.708333333333333in"}

 Scenarios where a need for product sense is sought include having the
 skills and insight to tackle the following:

1.  How can you enhance an existing product to better meet customer
     needs and preferences?

2.  What features should be prioritized in a new product to effectively
     solve key user pain points?

3.  How do you identify and interpret key data points to achieve
     product-market fit?

 None of these questions are easy. Nor will you magically wake up one
 morning and have all the answers in your head. Instead obtaining
 product sense takes time. It requires listening to your customers,
 understanding their pain points (especially those that go unsaid), and
 being able to devise an approach that aligns with your business or
 organization.

 These characteristics of product sense may sound similar to being a
 product manager. They are, yet, they are only one important aspect of
 the role. At the start of your product management career, you learn
 what is involved in being a product manager. You gain the skills
 needed to apply and turn product sense into action. The [[following
 image]{.underline}](https://adhoc.team/2021/01/13/what-being-a-product-manager-is-like/)
 does a great job of conveying this nuance.

 ![](media/image3.png){width="6.5in" height="2.0416666666666665in"}

 I appreciate the desire to want to dive in and do it all right from
 the start. Don't lose that energy. Instead recall other parts of your
 life. Let's say you want to run a marathon. That's awesome, but you
 should probably have experience walking or running a short distance
 first. Once you have the foundational knowledge to tackle short
 distances, you have the grounding to define your approach to running a
 marathon. At each stage, you're learning --- building your product
 (running) sense.

### How do you develop product sense?

 Expanding on the prior section, at the start of your product career,
 you typically work alongside another product manager or colleague who
 has more experience --- in the product, customer, and/or business. The
 product strategy and product roadmap will be shared with you, but you
 will not define them. Instead in your area of work, you will be given
 the priorities to deliver.

 Right from the start, you get whiffs of product sense. **You learn
 from your more experienced colleagues about the customer insight that
 went into shaping their thinking.** Lean into curiosity and be open
 minded. Seek diverse perspectives using prompts such as the following:

-   Can you share the customer insights that influenced your approach?

-   If you could start again, would you do anything differently?

-   How has your user understanding evolved since working on this
     product?

 Once you have a foundation in what it means to be a product manager,
 you will be given a new area of work to explore; an item that has not
 yet been prioritized. Apply the knowledge from your colleagues to
 start determining what would be of value to customers and to the
 business. **At each stage of the product development lifecycle there
 is an opportunity to increase your product sense.**

-   **Discovery** --- Uncover customer needs through market and user
     research. Explore the problem space which aligns with your
     business. Each finding is an opportunity to gain customer empathy
     and grow your product sense.

-   **Definition** --- Refine your knowledge by testing the riskiest
     hypothesis. With every new learning your customer empathy (product
     sense) builds, and your route to an MVP becomes clearer.

-   **Development** --- Pilot early stage ideas with customers to
     identify and build an MVP. You are gaining additional domain
     knowledge and creative insights (product sense) which enhances
     cross-functional collaboration.

-   **Delivery** --- Refine your MVP and subsequent build outs with
     customer feedback and cross functional input. Product sense has
     enabled you to reach this milestone as empathy for your customers
     continues to grow.

### Is product sense necessary or a nice to have?

 Even though product sense is a critical component of product
 management, it is not the only skill a product manager calls upon.
 Yet, without product sense a product manager would be leaving customer
 understanding (empathy) and effective solution development
 (creativity) to chance. You'd be blindfolded, spun around a few times,
 and then asked to throw a dart at a dart board. You might hit the
 board, but your chances are slim.

 Thoughts might be bouncing to Steve Jobs or Henry Ford suggesting
 asking customers what they want is not effective, as customers base
 their response on what they currently know is possible.

 *[Some people say give the customers what they want, but that's not my
 approach. Our job is to figure out what they're going to want before
 they do. I think Henry Ford once said, "If I'd ask customers what they
 wanted, they would've told me a faster horse." People don't know what
 they want until you show it to them. That's why I never rely on market
 research. Our task is to read things that are not yet on the page. ---
 Steve Jobs
 ([[link]{.underline}](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/this-was-steve-jobs-most-controversial-legacy-it-was-also-his-most-brilliant.html))]{.mark}*

 Product sense does not mean building products exactly to customer
 specifications. It means mixing together insight into customer wants,
 needs and expectations with market trends, emerging technology
 developments, and competitor insight plus the company's unique product
 know how.

 It's product sense that lets you extract what customer are actually
 seeking. It's product sense that enables you to collaborate with your
 colleagues to create a new approach which surpasses their expectations
 in a way that puts alternative offerings to shame.

 If your customers do not want change, that's product sense too. You
 know where, when and how to lean into evolving your product in a way
 that retains and does not alienate your customers.

### Does product sense go stale over time?

 Product sense can go "stale" and requires topping up. If you have left
 an industry or company and then returned a few years later, it's
 likely the market has moved on. New competitors will have entered, new
 technologies introduced, and subsequently customer expectations
 changed. As a result, a product manager should continually devote time
 to building up their product sense by following trends, tracking
 thought leaders, attending conferences, and reading market research.

 A product manager can enter a company with a level of product sense
 from time at a competitor in the same or a similar industry. That
 prior experience will not be enough as each company has a slightly
 different approach and/or positioning in the market which necessitates
 gaining new customer and product insight.

 As there are numerous paths into product management, product sense
 also can be gained from experience in another role. For example, when
 I was at Macromedia (before being purchased by Adobe), I was a
 marketing customer of a CRM product by an early dot.com called
 E.piphany. Then I joined E.piphany. Even though I entered with
 customer empathy, I only had my experience to call upon. I knew the
 market and technology, but only through a marketing lens. I needed to
 build up my product sense by learning from other E.piphany customers,
 colleagues and developments.

### Does product sense vary by industry or role?

 In regulated fields like healthcare or education, product managers
 might lack direct customer access. Each interaction along the way
 introduces different viewpoints. A therapist may be required to ask
 clients to complete a complicated form due to insurance purposes.
 Apply product sense to identify creative ways to make the experience
 as painless as possible for the therapist and client. In a similar
 manner, leaning into product sense helps balance the academic rigor
 desired by teachers and parents with a learning science approach that
 will engage students.

 In regulated industries, the need for sharing insight gained by any
 part of the business ramps up to 11. The leads across disciplines ---
 from product to design to customer success and beyond --- should
 actively break down silos and distribute up-to-date customer insight.
 I recommend leaning into [[collaboration not
 credit]{.underline}](https://dianastepner.substack.com/p/product-management-performance-reimagined)
 to ensure access to customer insight does not become a "privilege" of
 a select few employees or teams.

 If access to customers is insufficient, empower your team --- and
 yourself --- to lean into creative opportunities. For example,
 customers can be engaged at conferences, through market research
 studies, via customer success calls, joining sales discussions, and
 through data analysis.

### What to do once you have product sense?

 Bias towards action and start exploring the edges, what others have
 ignored. Identify two-way door decisions others are not willing to
 pursue because the work involved is difficult. Lean into your gut
 feeling and approaches such as the following:

-   Risk is not for the faint of heart nor is product management.

-   If someone says "you're crazy", you're on the right track.

-   Stop stressing about 'doing product right'. Instead focus on what
     you could do to make your product better for your customers.

-   Nobody has it all figured out. If the work doesn't look exactly like
     a case study you read, that's ok.

 Why? Customers have product sense too. They can sense when a company
 is passionate about their products. Jony Ive
 [[shares]{.underline}](https://twitter.com/StartupArchive_/status/1766083999028441270)
 customers can sense the care and craftsmanship put into a product,
 even if they can't articulate why. Creating thoughtful, well-designed
 products is a differentiator that drives customer satisfaction and
 retention.

 Help others develop their product sense. Remember [[people-first
 product leadership]{.underline}](https://dianastepner.substack.com/)
 means helping others tackle new challenges themselves, not just giving
 them solutions. Encourage the sharing of ideas and brainstorming
 together, so all involved can grow product sense too. Together you
 will end up with a very happy customer.

# **How to develop product sense**

### Q: How do I develop product sense?

Your question implies that it *can* be developed, and to that point, I
1,000% agree. Contrary to what a lot of PMs believe, product sense is
not something you need to be born with. It's a learned skill, just like
any other PM skill. Sure, some people are naturally better at it, but
that's OK. You don't need to be in the 99th percentile of this skill to
be an incredibly successful PM. That being said, you are building a
product as your job, and are often the final word on product decisions,
so you absolutely do need to develop your product sense muscle,
especially as you move up in seniority.

To help you build your product sense, I've asked [[Jules
Walter]{.underline}](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juleswalter/), a
longtime PM at Slack and YouTube who's also a prominent leader in the
broader PM community, to share his hard-earned wisdom with us. Below,
Jules unravels the mystery that is product sense. He shares a ton of
actionable and practical advice to develop your product sense, explains
what product sense is, how to know if you're getting better, and dives
deep into four concrete ways to build this skill with a bunch of
examples from his own experience. Enjoy!

your product sense, you may not know if you're any good at it, or how to
get better. I want to help.

## **What exactly is product sense? 🤔**

**Product sense is the skill of consistently being able to craft
products (or make changes to existing products) that have the intended
impact on their users.** Product sense relies on (1) **empathy** to
discover meaningful user needs and (2) **creativity** to come up with
solutions that effectively address those needs.

![](media/image22.jpg){width="6.5in" height="4.708333333333333in"}

You likely have good product sense if you've championed successful
features or products that were not obvious to others. Here are some
examples of products born out of strong product sense:

-   The original iPhone was built on the insight that people value
     aesthetics, and not just functionality, in their products. It was
     designed around the idea that consumers needed a smartphone that
     felt personal.

-   The original Gmail responded to unmet user needs at the time. It
     addressed common user problems, including low storage quotas, poor
     search experience, and related messages separated from each other
     (instead of being combined in a thread).

-   Superhuman saw a need for a modern email client to allow busy
     professionals to get through emails quickly. It used thoughtful
     design to support fast email workflows and limit distractions.

Each of these products originated with strong product sense and offered
creative solutions to previously unmet user needs.

## **Building product sense**

I was the first PM on Slack's growth team, where I spent more than four
years building product experiences used by millions of people. I'm now a
product leader at YouTube, where I'm building a yet-to-be-released
zero-to-one product.

In my roles, I've relied on product sense to bring unique insights to
the table and drive user value and business impact. In this article, I
will be discussing four practices for building product sense.

**Building empathy:**

1.  Observe people interacting with products

2.  Deconstruct everyday products

**Improving creativity:**

3.  Learn from great product thinkers

4.  Be curious about changes in technology and your domain

Let's get to it.

### **1. Observe people interacting with products 🕵🏾**

One approach to developing empathy---and thus, product sense---is to
repeatedly observe people using products, whether yours or other
companies'. This practice will help you get better at identifying subtle
user needs that others miss (e.g. social, emotional, or functional
needs).

You can start small. Initially, I recommend doing this two to four times
a month for your product. Don't just read reports from researchers on
your team; instead attend user research sessions to get firsthand
exposure to user experiences and reactions. What's important is to pay
attention to micro details and ask yourself why people react to your
product the way they do. Observe their facial expressions as they try
various aspects of your product, and try to spot moments when they're
hesitant, confused, excited, etc. In those moments, ask open-ended
questions to better understand not just how they feel but, more
importantly, *why*.

Here are some sample questions you can ask:

1.  What do you think the purpose of this product is? Who do you think
     it's for? *This will give you a sense of how effective your
     product's landing page is. It also gives you ideas for words to
     describe your product that resonate with people.*

2.  Now that you're in the product, what actions do you want to take?
     *This will help you understand which features are easy to discover
     and how clear your product's navigation and calls to action are.*

3.  What are you thinking right now? How does that make you feel? *I
     tend to ask this at every new step the user lands on, because
     people tend not to notice their self-talk and feelings otherwise.*

When I joined Slack in 2016, our data indicated high churn rates for new
users on mobile. We wanted to understand why, so we set up user research
sessions and asked questions such as the ones above. Through those
questions and through observing users, we learned that:

-   Many people didn't really understand what Slack did, even after
     visiting our homepage, which was too abstract at the time.

-   People would land in the Slack app and not know what to do because
     of competing calls to action.

-   People didn't want to give permission to their mobile address book,
     because it had their friends' contact info and not their
     colleagues'.

These new insights led us to come up with experiment ideas that enabled
us to improve Slack's product experience for new users and significantly
increase the product's retention rate. Below is one such experiment,
which removed friction in the invite step and addressed users' concerns
around giving permission to their address books.

After observing hundreds of people use products I've worked on (whether
in research sessions or coffee shops etc.) and asking them questions
about their usage, I've developed better instincts about how people will
react to various product experiences. Here are five quick lessons about
product usage that have stuck with me:

1.  **People are time-crunched and distracted when they use your
     product.** They might not read labels or text and might not be
     willing to spend even a few seconds to figure out what to do next.
     Pick the right defaults and use visual design and cues to make
     primary actions obvious (e.g. prominence, lack of distractions).

2.  **People will drop out of a product flow as soon as they feel
     confused or nervous** that they might be doing something wrong.
     Make sure labels are unambiguous and contrast options
     appropriately.

3.  **Don't give people too much information at once**, because once
     they feel overwhelmed, they tend to leave. For example, we ran
     pricing page experiments at Slack and saw increases in purchases
     when we moved some of the information on the various purchase
     options behind a dropdown list.

4.  **Context impacts decisions.** Use tools like comparisons,
     contrasting, and social proof to make it easier for users to make
     a decision.

5.  **Make sure the goal of your product and possible actions are clear
     to users.** At Slack, we often heard from users that they didn't
     know what Slack was really about and what they could do with the
     app. We experimented with various onboarding experiences to
     address that issue, and one early experiment on mobile increased
     user retention just by telling new users what Slack is and linking
     to a video showing people how a work team might use it on desktop
     and mobile.

The more frequently and closely you watch people using products, the
more observant you'll become and the more empathy you'll develop.

### **2. Deconstruct everyday products 👨🏾‍🔧️**

Another approach to developing empathy is to observe *yourself* using
everyday products. I spend one or two hours a month trying out new
products and deconstructing them. The goal is to strengthen my intuition
about why some products work well and others don't---this also helps me
identify common UX best practices and paradigms. While deconstructing
products, I recommend asking the types of questions Julie Zhuo shares in
the article [[How to Do a Product
Critique]{.underline}](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/how-to-do-a-product-critique-98b657050638#.v5o81mocz),
such as:

1.  What's the experience of getting started or signing up?

2.  How does this app explain itself in the first minute?

3.  How easy to use was the app?

4.  How did you feel while exploring the app?

5.  Did the app deliver on your expectations?

If you want to go deeper in your understanding of a product, I recommend
also looking at other products in the same category and comparing and
contrasting them. For example, to better understand a product like
[[Cash App]{.underline}](https://cash.app/), compare it with
[[Venmo]{.underline}](https://venmo.com/). You'll see that these two
seemingly similar money apps are fundamentally different. Below are a
few dimensions you can look at to compare two products and better
understand how they approach product decisions.

![](media/image17.jpg){width="6.5in" height="3.6666666666666665in"}

![](media/image20.jpg){width="6.5in" height="3.2777777777777777in"}

![](media/image13.jpg){width="6.5in" height="3.875in"}

By comparing a product with others in the space, some of the product
design choices become more salient and it's easier to get hints of the
product's strategy. For example, in the Cash App vs. Venmo comparison,
it seems Venmo's strategy is to lean into its social graph (use Venmo
because your friends are already on it and you can easily make sure
you're sending the money to the right person), whereas Cash App is
focused on ease of use and breadth of capabilities for people who want
to go beyond just peer-to-peer transfers (run your personal finances or
small business from your phone).

When I use new products, I also observe my own self-talk and feelings,
including moments of frustration, such as:

-   I'm trying to log in to my medical app to set up an appointment, but
     I'm unable to because I can't remember my password. The password
     reset flow never sent me an email, even after multiple attempts,
     and I just stopped using the service.

-   I'm trying to rent a car, but as soon as I input the start time, the
     interface shows an error message telling me that the end time
     can't be before the start time. I was going to update the end time
     anyway, and now I feel stupid and frustrated while using this
     product, which is not a feeling you want your users to have.

I also note moments when I experience delight, such as:

-   Carta's stock-vesting email could have been just text letting me
     know that I've vested into more shares, but it also includes an
     animation with confetti that takes my feeling of celebration to
     another level.

-   Google Photos collages combine multiple photos of the people who
     matter to me the most in delightful ways.

One bonus practice I recommend for improving your empathy and
observation skills is meditation. I've been meditating for years, and
it's helped me become more perceptive---not just of other people's
feelings but also of my own. If you are new to meditation, I recommend
starting with an
[[app]{.underline}](https://www.fitmind.co/fitmind-meditation-app) or
joining a [[meditation
community]{.underline}](https://sundaysangha.net/) to help you form a
daily habit.

​​The more frequently and closely you observe people (and yourself), the
more insight you will gain into their motivations and needs, and the
more your empathy will grow.

### **3. Learn from great product thinkers 📓**

One of the biggest levers for developing creativity (and again, product
sense) is to spend time with people who already have it.

My creativity improved significantly after I joined Slack, partly
because I observed how people like CEO Stewart Butterfield approached
building products. If you've never worked at a company with strong
product thinkers, I recommend joining such a company at some point in
your career to strengthen your product fundamentals---the earlier, the
better. If you're not sure which companies to consider, start by
thinking of companies whose products you use and love.

Once you're at a company with great product thinkers, I recommend
attending as many product reviews as you can. Take copious notes during
the reviews, and look for patterns in the questions and feedback you
hear---i.e. what type of comments keep coming up. Over time, you'll
understand the mental checklists your product leaders use to ensure that
new product ideas will be successful, and you'll identify the principles
they use to make product decisions and trade-offs.

One of the things I learned from my exposure to Stewart Butterfield is
that *every* detail about the user experience matters. "The details are
not the details," he would say, quoting designer Charles Eames. "They
make the design." Stewart's obsession with the details is one of the
main reasons why Slack exists and is used by millions of people.

For example, if a user tries to use \@channel to message a large number
of teammates across multiple time zones in Slack, they'll see a cartoon
rooster (below) asking them to think twice about notifying these people.
It's a detail that wasn't built to move metrics but rather to prevent
anxiety for people who would otherwise receive work notifications at odd
hours. The rooster icon was chosen to keep the tone playful so that the
message sender doesn't feel ashamed or guilty when they read the
warning.

![](media/image9.jpg){width="2.861111111111111in"
height="6.611111111111111in"}

This type of product detail can mean a lot to users. When I would review
customer tickets at Slack, many of them were positive feedback from
people thanking us for the thoughtfulness that the team put into the
product. Sometimes people couldn't even say exactly *why* they loved
Slack---partly because what drew them wasn't one big feature, but rather
the attention to details across the product. I've learned that if you
remove from your product lots of small annoyances that people deal with
on a daily basis, the value you get from doing that adds up to something
meaningful.

Another lesson I learned from Stewart is to spend time understanding
user problems and framing them in a way that sets strong constraints for
the team. Many PMs jump into solution-finding before they truly
understand the problem. This leads to ineffective solutions, or
indecisiveness as their teams struggle to eliminate potential solutions.
If you understand why a problem exists and frame it clearly, you will
identify enough constraints that only a few solutions will be left,
streamlining the decision-making process. For example, in the article
[[Are You Solving the Right
Problems?]{.underline}](https://hbr.org/2017/01/are-you-solving-the-right-problems),
Thomas Wedell-Wedellsborg gives an example of how two different framings
of a problem lead to completely different solutions:

![](media/image7.jpg){width="6.5in" height="2.8333333333333335in"}

This ability to reframe problems and set opinionated constraints is a
key skill I've seen product thinkers use to drive creative solutions.

If, on the other hand, you don't work at a company with strong product
thinkers, look for external mentors and read articles or interviews from
people such as [[Julie
Zhuo]{.underline}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b78zq-kimVs),
[[Stewart
Butterfield]{.underline}](https://medium.com/@stewart/we-dont-sell-saddles-here-4c59524d650d),
[[David
Lieb]{.underline}](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/5f-on-starting-and-scaling-one-of-the-biggest-ios-apps),
and [[Rahul
Vohra]{.underline}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaxAdRlyZQ8).

If you're able to connect with great product thinkers, here are some
sample questions you can ask to better understand their processes and
insights:

-   What prompted you to build your product? *This will give you a sense
     of the type of user insights you should be looking for and the
     process to get them.*

-   What were the key decision points along the way?

-   What alternative approaches did you consider? *For ambiguous
     problems, you have to explore multiple approaches before you land
     on one that works. Understanding the solutions that were
     discarded, and why, will help you get a sense of how they test
     hypotheses and make trade-offs.*

-   What were surprising insights or results? *Knowing when their
     initial hypotheses were wrong and understanding why can help you
     uncover great insights.*

-   What principles or frameworks helped you navigate the ambiguity?
     *Great product thinkers internalize product principles they use to
     evaluate solutions. If you can uncover those principles, you can
     use them to guide your decisions as well.*

Gaining access to strong product thinkers may be difficult, but try to
read as many blog posts or watch as many videos as you can where product
leaders who you look up to share their thought processes.

### **4. Be curious about changes in technology and your domain📱**

Another practice for developing creativity is to spend time learning
about emerging trends in technology, society, and regulations. Changes
in the industry create opportunities for launching new products that can
address user needs in new ways. As a PM, you want to understand what's
possible in your domain in order to come up with creative solutions. For
example:

-   Cash App decided to support Bitcoin transactions, and as a result,
     76% (nearly \$4.6 billion) of its 2020 revenues came from Bitcoin.
     For more examples of products that benefited from new trends, see
     Lenny's article [[Why
     now]{.underline}](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/why-now?).

-   Uber became possible because of the proliferation of smartphones
     with GPS capabilities and the availability of Google Maps APIs.

-   Clubhouse took off quickly because of the pandemic, which
     accelerated the need for virtual public discourse.

There are two levels at which you can look at emerging trends: the macro
and the micro. At the macro level, you should keep track of important
platform shifts (e.g. web3, AR/VR, AI), social shifts (e.g. the shift to
remote work), and changes in regulations (e.g. new privacy protection
laws). It's important to keep an open mind about new technologies,
because at first they receive a lot of skepticism and have obvious
flaws. I still remember when people were skeptical of e-commerce and
assumed it would never be safe to use credit cards online. When you see
a new trend, instead of dismissing it as a fad, ask yourself, "If this
trend reaches its full potential, what opportunities will it create that
I can pursue?"

There are many places to keep up with macro technology trends. For
example, you can:

-   Watch annual developer conferences from major tech companies to
     understand what areas they see as promising (e.g.
     [[Google]{.underline}](https://io.google/2021/?lng=en),
     [[Apple]{.underline}](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/),
     [[Meta]{.underline}](https://developers.facebook.com/f8/),
     [[Amazon]{.underline}](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/)).

-   Read commentary from industry analysts (e.g. [[Ben
     Thompson]{.underline}](https://stratechery.com/)).

-   Follow tech founders and investors on Twitter (e.g. [[Naval
     Ravikant]{.underline}](https://twitter.com/naval?), [[Elad
     Gil]{.underline}](https://twitter.com/eladgil?), [[Balaji
     Srinivasan]{.underline}](https://twitter.com/balajis)) and pay
     attention to trends they're bullish on.

-   Invest in or advise startups operating in spaces that interest you.
     If that's not possible, pay attention to what companies top VCs
     are investing in, and follow those companies.

While the macro trends are helpful in seeing where the industry is
going, many of the non-obvious opportunities lie in deeply understanding
micro changes that may unlock new possibilities. For example, Figma's
high-quality browser-based application for designers became possible
only once WebGL became performant enough. In order to understand the
nuances of micro changes, I recommend meeting with engineers and domain
experts and going deep with them on topics of interest, such as new APIs
or platform capabilities.

As Paul Graham said in [[How to Get Startup
Ideas]{.underline}](http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html), "Live in
the future, then build what's missing." Living in the future is also an
effective approach to developing your product sense.

## **How to tell if you're getting better at product sense 📈**

Developing product sense takes time and practice. As you get better at
it, you'll:

-   Notice subtle things about products and people that you would have
     missed before (e.g. micro frustrations and delights)

-   Anticipate non-obvious user problems when you look at product
     experiences or before you present at product reviews

-   Develop higher-quality hypotheses about product experiences to
     build, even in the face of ambiguity

-   Contribute more unique insights to your team, given your improved
     understanding of users and the landscape

-   Be right more often than not about what impact a change to a flow
     has on metrics

-   And, potentially, receive comments from your design partner on how
     impressed they are with a detail you noticed

I hope you decide to invest in developing your product sense, and that
the practices in this article, on strengthening empathy and creativity,
are as useful to you as they've been to me.
