# Lenny's Podcast Learning Paths

> Role-based learning paths from Lenny's Podcast for Sr. Product Managers

## Overview

This directory contains curated learning paths that synthesize insights from 300+ Lenny's Podcast episodes and apply them to **core Sr. PM competencies** that are portable across any product or company.

**Key Change (January 2026)**: These paths are now **role-based** rather than product-focused. Instead of learning about "AgilePlace" or "OKRs," you'll develop portable skills like strategic thinking, leadership, customer discovery, team design, and prioritization—skills that advance your career whether you're at Planview or anywhere else.

Each learning path is designed to be:
- **Portable**: Skills that apply across any B2B SaaS product or role
- **Career-Focused**: Shows how capabilities scale from Sr. PM → Director → VP
- **Actionable**: "Practice This Skill" exercises for on-the-job application
- **Efficient**: 5-10 curated episodes per path (not all 300+)
