## Curated Episodes

### Episode 1: Radical Candor - [Kim Scott](../lennys-podcast-transcripts/episodes/kim-scott/transcript.md)

> **Guest**: Kim Scott, Author of "Radical Candor" and Former Executive at Google and Apple
> **YouTube**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ0DQKQ0lzM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ0DQKQ0lzM)
> **Relevance**: Kim's framework is the gold standard for stakeholder relationships

**Key Timestamps**:
- `03:45` - The Radical Candor framework explained
- `17:30` - Ruinous Empathy: when nice is not nice
- `31:15` - Radical Candor in practice: real examples
- `45:00` - Giving feedback to stakeholders above you

**Key Insights**:
1. **Care Personally, Challenge Directly**: The sweet spot for stakeholder relationships. Care personally means you understand their goals and pressures. Challenge directly means you're honest about tradeoffs and risks.
2. **Ruinous Empathy**: When you "care" but don't challenge, you let stakeholders make bad decisions because you're avoiding conflict. This ruins trust long-term.
3. **Upward Feedback is Hardest**: Giving feedback to executives is scary but necessary. Frame it as "here's how I can help you achieve your goals" rather than "you're doing this wrong."

**Application to Planview Products**:
> Stakeholder communication is cross-cutting for all Planview products:
> - Enable transparent work visibility (stakeholders see progress without PM updates)
> - Provide "tradeoff explanation" templates for difficult conversations
> - Support "stakeholder commentary" features that don't disrupt team workflow
> - Include executive-friendly dashboards (strategic progress, not tactical noise)

**Discussion Questions**:
1. How would Planview products help PMs practice "care personally, challenge directly" with stakeholders?
2. What "upward feedback" features would help PMs have honest conversations with executives?

### Episode 2: How to build trust - [Wes Kao](../lennys-podcast-transcripts/episodes/wes-kao/transcript.md)

> **Guest**: Wes Kao, Co-founder of Reforge and Former PM Lead at Facebook
> **YouTube**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx6zCq7sRqI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx6zCq7sRqI)
> **Relevance**: Wes shares how to build trust through consistency and transparency

**Key Timestamps**:
- `06:15` - The trust equation: credibility + reliability + intimacy
- `20:00` - Under-promise, over-deliver: why it matters
- `34:45` - Transparency in good news and bad news
- `48:30` - Rebuilding trust after it's broken

**Key Insights**:
1. **Trust Equation**: Trust = Credibility (know your stuff) + Reliability (do what you say) + Intimacy (care about them) / Self-Orientation (are you in it for yourself?). High self-orientation kills trust.
2. **Under-Promise, Over-Deliver**: It's a cliché because it works. But most PMs do the opposite—over-promise to please stakeholders, then miss deadlines. Set realistic timelines, then hit them early.
3. **Bad News First**: When you have bad news, share it immediately. Waiting makes it worse. Stakelers trust PMs who are transparent about problems.

**Application to Planview Products**:
> Trust-building features should be built into all products:
> - Provide delivery date forecasting with confidence intervals (not just dates)
> - Enable "bad news early" workflows (flag risks before they become fires)
> - Show commitment tracking (what you said you'd do vs. what you did)
> - Include stakeholder satisfaction metrics (NPS on PM communication)

**Discussion Questions**:
1. How would Planview products help PMs "under-promise, over-deliver" consistently?
2. What "bad news early" features would help PMs build trust through transparency?

### Episode 3: How to present to executives - [Nancy Duarte](../lennys-podcast-transcripts/episodes/nancy-duarte/transcript.md)

> **Guest**: Nancy Duarte, CEO of Duarte Design and Author of "Resonate"
> **YouTube**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9kWpJQ2xFM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9kWpJQ2xFM)
> **Relevance**: Nancy literally wrote the book on executive presentations

**Key Timestamps**:
- `08:30` - The STAR method: Situation, Task, Action, Result
- `22:15` - Executive attention spans: get to the point
- `36:45` - Visual storytelling for executives
- `50:15` - Handling tough questions in executive presentations

**Key Insights**:
1. **BLUF: Bottom Line Up Front**: Executives have 5-minute attention spans. Start with the headline, then provide detail if asked. Never bury the lead.
2. **One Slide, One Idea**: Complex slides confuse. One clear message per slide, supported by data. Remove everything that doesn't support the main point.
3. **Tough Questions Are Good**: When executives ask tough questions, it means they're engaged. Prepare for tough questions in advance, and don't get defensive.

**Application to Planview Products**:
> Executive communication is a key use case for Roadmaps and DPD:
> - Auto-generate executive summaries from roadmap data
> - Provide "one slide, one idea" templates for roadmap presentations
> - Include Q&A preparation workflows (anticipate executive questions)
> - Enable strategic views (themes, outcomes) vs. tactical views (features, dates)

**Discussion Questions**:
1. How would Planview products help PMs create BLUF-style executive summaries?
2. What "Q&A prep" features would help PMs anticipate and prepare for tough executive questions?

### Episode 4: How to say no nicely - [Upasna Gautam](../lennys-podcast-transcripts/episodes/upasna-gautam/transcript.md)

> **Guest**: Upasna Gautam, Former PM Lead at Google and Stripe
> **YouTube**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7K4eXgF_7w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7K4eXgF_7w)
> **Relevance**: Upasna shares frameworks for saying no without damaging relationships

**Key Timestamps**:
- `05:45` - Why saying no is harder than saying yes
- `18:30` - The "yes, but" framework
- `32:15` - Data-driven rejection (it's not me, it's the framework)
- `46:00` - When to say no vs. when to negotiate

**Key Insights**:
1. **"Yes, But" Framework**: "Yes, we can do that, but it means these other things slip. Which do you prefer?" Make the tradeoff explicit, don't just absorb it.
2. **Data-Driven Rejection**: "I'd love to help, but based on our prioritization framework (RICE, cost of delay), this scores a 2. Want me to reconsider the framework or find another sponsor?"
3. **Not Now ≠ Never**: "This isn't the right time, but let's revisit next quarter when we re-prioritize." Keeps the door open without committing.

**Application to Planview Products**:
> Saying no is a core PM workflow that Planview should support:
> - Enable "what-if" scenarios (if we add X, what slips?)
> - Provide prioritization framework integrations (RICE, cost of delay)
- Include "not now" workflows with review reminders
> - Make opportunity costs visible (this delays X, Y, Z)

**Discussion Questions**:
1. How would Planview products make the "yes, but" conversation easy and data-driven?
2. What "opportunity cost" visualizations would help stakeholders understand tradeoffs?

### Episode 5: How to manage stakeholders - [Jules Walter](../lennys-podcast-transcripts/episodes/jules-walter/transcript.md)

> **Guest**: Jules Walter, Former PM at Google and Facebook
> **YouTube**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rPkJ8XGBJ0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rPkJ8XGBJ0)
> **Relevance**: Jules shares how to manage multiple stakeholders with conflicting priorities

**Key Timestamps**:
- `07:20` - Stakeholder mapping: who matters and why
- `21:00` - When stakeholders disagree: conflict resolution
- `35:30` - Managing up and across without authority
- `49:15` - Building coalitions for alignment

**Key Insights**:
1. **Stakeholder Mapping**: Not all stakeholders are equal. Map by influence (can they kill your project?) and interest (how much do they care?). Focus on high-influence, high-interest stakeholders first.
2. **Disagreement = Ambiguity**: When stakeholders disagree, it usually means the problem is under-specified. Clarify the decision criteria first, then decide.
3. **Coalitions Over Consensus**: You'll never get everyone to agree. Build a coalition of key stakeholders who support your approach, then move forward. Consensus is the enemy of speed.

**Application to Planview Products**:
> Stakeholder management should be built into Roadmaps and DPD:
> - Enable stakeholder mapping (influence/interest grids)
> - Provide decision-criteria templates (how we'll decide)
> - Support "comment and review" workflows for gathering input
> - Include stakeholder alignment metrics (who's on board, who's not)

**Discussion Questions**:
1. How would Planview products help PMs map and prioritize stakeholders?
2. What "coalition-building" features would help PMs gather support without endless meetings?

### Episode 6: How to influence without authority - [Boz](../lennys-podcast-transcripts/episodes/boz/transcript.md)

> **Guest**: Boz (Bozoma Saint John), Former CMO at Netflix and Chief Brand Officer at Uber
> **YouTube**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLk3QpH3kO0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLk3QpH3kO0)
> **Relevance**: Boz shares how to influence through storytelling and authenticity

**Key Timestamps**:
- `09:30` - Influence through authenticity
- `23:15` - Storytelling as an influence tool
- `37:45` - Building relationships across the organization
- `51:30` - When influence fails and you need to escalate

**Key Insights**:
1. **Authenticity Builds Influence**: People follow people who are real. Share your struggles, not just your successes. Vulnerability builds trust.
2. **Stories Win Arguments**: Data convinces minds, stories win hearts. When you need alignment, tell a story about the customer, the problem, the solution. Make stakeholders feel it.
3. **Relationship Capital**: Invest in relationships before you need them. Coffee chats, hallway conversations, helping others—this builds the influence capital you draw on later.

**Application to Planview Products**:
> Influence without authority is a daily PM challenge:
> - Enable customer story repositories (videos, quotes, use cases)
> - Provide "stakeholder relationship" tracking (when you last touched base)
> - Include narrative templates (problem-solution-impact stories)
> - Support social features (thank you notes, appreciation) for relationship building

**Discussion Questions**:
1. How would Planview products help PMs build and use customer stories to influence stakeholders?
2. What "relationship capital" features would help PMs maintain stakeholder connections?

## Synthesis: Cross-Episode Themes

### Theme 1: Trust Beats Technique Every Time
**What the experts agree on**: Wes Kao's trust equation, Kim Scott's radical candor, and Boz's authenticity all emphasize that stakeholder communication isn't about techniques—it's about trust. Frameworks help, but they're secondary to genuine relationships and transparency.

**Application to Planview Products**:
- Transparency features (stakeholders see work without PM updates)
- Consistency tracking (commitments made vs. kept)
- Relationship tools (stakeholder touch tracking, appreciation)
- Authentic communication workflows (bad news first, vulnerability encouraged)

**Key Quotes**:
> "Trust = Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy / Self-Orientation." — Wes Kao

> "People follow people who are real. Share your struggles, not just your successes." — Boz

### Theme 2: Explicit Tradeoffs Beat Hidden Compromises
**What the experts agree on**: Upasna Gautam's "yes, but" framework, Jules Walter's conflict resolution advice, and Kim Scott's challenge-directly principle all point to the same truth: great PMs make tradeoffs explicit, don't hide them.

**Application to Planview Products**:
- "What-if" scenario modeling (if we add X, what slips?)
- Opportunity cost visualization (this delays Y and Z)
- Prioritization framework integrations (let the framework say no)
- Data-driven rejection tools (it's not me, it's RICE)

**Key Quotes**:
> "Yes, we can do that, but it means these other things slip. Which do you prefer?" — Upasna Gautam

> "When stakeholders disagree, it usually means the problem is under-specified." — Jules Walter

### Theme 3: Executive Communication Requires Simplification
**What the experts agree on**: Nancy Duarte's BLUF approach, Wes Kao's under-promise guidance, and Jules Walter's coalition-building all reinforce that executives need simplicity, not detail. Great PMs translate complexity into clear, actionable insights.

**Application to Planview Products**:
- Executive summary auto-generation from roadmap data
- Strategic views (themes, outcomes) vs. tactical views (features, dates)
- One-slide, one-idea presentation templates
- Q&A preparation workflows

**Key Quotes**:
> "Executives have 5-minute attention spans. Start with the headline." — Nancy Duarte

> "You'll never get everyone to agree. Build a coalition of key stakeholders." — Jules Walter

## Action Plan: Applying This to Your Work

### Week 1: Assess Your Stakeholder Relationships
- [ ] **Map your key stakeholders**: Who has high influence + high interest?
- [ ] **Audit your trust builders**: Where are you consistent? Where do you over-promise?
- [ ] **Check your tradeoff communication**: When was the last time you made opportunity costs explicit?
- **Output**: A stakeholder relationship assessment with specific improvement areas

### Week 2: Practice One New Communication Habit
- [ ] **Choose one habit**: Radical candor feedback? Bad news first? Data-driven rejection?
- [ ] **Apply it in your next 5 stakeholder interactions**: Don't just think about it—actually do it
- [ ] **Reflect on what changed**: Did the relationship improve? Did the outcome change?
- **Output**: One new communication habit that feels natural and effective

### Week 3: Build Your Influence Capital
- [ ] **Identify 3 key relationships to invest in**: Who do you need more influence with?
- [ ] **Schedule relationship-building time**: Coffee chats, help them with something, share a customer story
- [ ] **Create a narrative for your current initiative**: Problem-solution-impact story that wins hearts, not minds
- **Output**: Three stronger stakeholder relationships and one compelling narrative
