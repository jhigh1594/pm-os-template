## Curated Episodes

### Episode 1: The art of product management - [Shreyas Doshi](../lennys-podcast-transcripts/episodes/shreyas-doshi/transcript.md)

> **Guest**: Shreyas Doshi, Former PM at Stripe, Twitter, Google, Yahoo
> **YouTube**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_QghPLG-8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_QghPLG-8)
> **Relevance**: Shreyas discusses the three levels of product work and why execution problems are often strategy problems—critical for roadmap alignment

**Key Timestamps**:
- `12:30` - The three levels of product work (tactical vs. strategic vs. visionary)
- `24:15` - Why most execution problems are really strategy problems
- `38:45` - Pre-mortems for roadmap planning
- `52:00` - Prioritization pitfalls and how to avoid them

**Key Insights**:
1. **Strategic vs. Tactical Work**: Teams confuse execution with strategy. A roadmap isn't just "what we're building"—it's a manifestation of strategic choices about what NOT to build.
2. **Pre-Mortems Power**: Before finalizing any roadmap quadrant, run a pre-mortem: "It's 6 months from now and this initiative failed. Why?" This reveals hidden risks and dependencies.
3. **The Cost of Yes**: Every roadmap item you say "yes" to means saying "no" to something else. Make tradeoffs explicit, not implicit.

**Application to Roadmaps Product**:
> Roadmaps customers struggle with stakeholder alignment because they can't make tradeoffs visible. Use Shreyas' framework to help customers:
> - Map roadmap items to strategic themes (not just features)
> - Run pre-mortems on major roadmap initiatives
> - Make opportunity costs visible: "If we prioritize X, we're delaying Y"
> - Connect roadmap items to measurable outcomes, not just output

**Discussion Questions**:
1. How would you explain the "three levels of product work" to a Roadmaps prospect struggling with tactical firefighting?
2. What pre-mortem questions would you build into the Roadmaps product as guided workflows?

### Episode 2: How to prioritize - [Gibson Biddle](../lennys-podcast-transcripts/episodes/gibson-biddle/transcript.md)

> **Guest**: Gibson Biddle, Former VP Product at Netflix and Chegg
> **YouTube**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDfJLPPUQ5g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDfJLPPUQ5g)
> **Relevance**: Gibson created the RICE framework and shares how Netflix prioritized in hyper-growth phase

**Key Timestamps**:
- `08:20` - The RICE framework walkthrough
- `18:45` - How Netflix balanced growth vs. engagement vs. monetization
- `32:00` - When to break the rules and trust your gut
- `45:30` - Prioritizing in enterprise vs. consumer contexts

**Key Insights**:
1. **RICE Framework**: Reach × Impact × Confidence / Effort = prioritization score. But it's a guide, not a god—use it to spark debate, not end it.
2. **Strategic Buckets**: Netflix used "delight," "growth," and "monetization" as strategic buckets. Every quarter, allocate capacity across these buckets first, then prioritize within them.
3. **Confidence Matters**: When impact is high but confidence is low, that's a signal to do more research—not to reject the opportunity outright.

**Application to Roadmaps Product**:
> RICE is simple enough for enterprise teams but rigorous enough for strategic decisions. Roadmaps should:
> - Support custom prioritization frameworks (RICE, Opportunity Scoring, etc.)
> - Allow strategic bucket allocation (e.g., "innovation vs. maintenance")
> - Track confidence scores separately from impact to flag research needs
> - Make the "why" behind prioritization visible, not just the "what"

**Discussion Questions**:
1. How would you integrate RICE into the Roadmaps product workflow without overwhelming enterprise users?
2. What strategic buckets make sense for typical Planview customers (e.g., "strategic initiatives," "customer commitments," "technical debt")?

### Episode 3: How product leaders should spend their time - [Ian McAllister](../lennys-podcast-transcripts/episodes/ian-mcallister/transcript.md)

> **Guest**: Ian McAllister, Former Director of Product at Airbnb and Amazon
> **YouTube**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w86M5fCJm2k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w86M5fCJm2k)
> **Relevance**: Ian discusses how senior PMs should balance strategic roadmap work with tactical execution

**Key Timestamps**:
- `06:15` - The 50/30/20 rule for time allocation
- `15:40` - When to delegate vs. when to dive deep
- `28:20` - Running effective roadmap review meetings
- `41:00` - Managing up and setting executive expectations

**Key Insights**:
1. **50/30/20 Rule**: 50% on strategic roadmap work, 30% on execution support, 20% on team building. Most PMs flip this—spending 50% on tactics and 20% on strategy.
2. **Roadmap Reviews as Strategy Sessions**: Don't just walk through Jira tickets. Use roadmap reviews to reinforce strategic decisions, surface risks, and align on tradeoffs.
3. **Managing Up**: Executives don't want to see your backlog—they want to see the narrative. Tell the story of how the roadmap connects to business outcomes.

**Application to Roadmaps Product**:
> Roadmaps should support the strategic work that Ian describes:
> - Enable "strategic view" that hides tactical noise (individual tickets) and focuses on themes/bets
> - Support executive-friendly roadmaps with business outcomes, not feature lists
> - Include "risk flags" and "dependency warnings" as first-class objects
> - Make it easy to generate narrative reports from roadmap data

**Discussion Questions**:
1. How would Roadmaps product help PMs shift from 20% strategic to 50% strategic time?
2. What "executive view" features would help PMs tell compelling stories to leadership?

### Episode 4: Product strategy - [Elena Verna](../lennys-podcast-transcripts/episodes/elena-verna/transcript.md)

> **Guest**: Elena Verna, Former SVP Growth at SurveyMonkey and Malwarebytes
> **YouTube**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej5lPYbCsQA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej5lPYbCsQA)
> **Relevance**: Elena discusses how strategy connects to roadmap and the importance of opportunity sizing

**Key Timestamps**:
- `11:30` - The difference between vision, strategy, and roadmap
- `22:15` - Opportunity sizing techniques (TAM, SAM, SOM)
- `35:40` - When to pivot strategy based on roadmap data
- `48:20` - Aligning product strategy with go-to-market

**Key Insights**:
1. **Vision → Strategy → Roadmap**: Vision is the "why," strategy is the "how," roadmap is the "what." Don't let roadmap discussions drift into strategy without being explicit about it.
2. **Opportunity Sizing**: Before anything goes on the roadmap, size the opportunity. If the upside is small, the roadmap slot isn't worth it—regardless of how easy it is.
3. **Data-Informed, Not Data-Driven**: Use roadmap data to inform strategy decisions, but don't let data paralyze you. Sometimes you ship to learn, not because you have perfect data.

**Application to Roadmaps Product**:
> The connection between strategy and roadmap is what enterprise teams struggle with most:
> - Enable "strategic themes" as organizing principles for roadmap items
> - Require opportunity sizing for major initiatives (not every feature)
> - Support "ship to learn" initiatives flagged as experiments
> - Provide templates for vision-strategy-roadmap alignment

**Discussion Questions**:
1. How would Roadmaps product make the vision-strategy-roadmap connection explicit and visible?
2. What "opportunity sizing" features are practical for enterprise teams without becoming overhead?

### Episode 5: How to build a product strategy - [Ken Norton](../lennys-podcast-transcripts/episodes/ken-norton/transcript.md)

> **Guest**: Ken Norton, Former Partner at Google Ventures and PM at Google
> **YouTube**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPJ0hZ3-caQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPJ0hZ3-caQ)
> **Relevance**: Ken shares the "strategic narratives" framework that connects product decisions to business outcomes

**Key Timestamps**:
- `09:45` - What is a strategic narrative?
- `19:30` - Writing narrative-driven strategy docs
- `34:15` - Using narratives to align stakeholders on roadmap
- `47:00` - Case study: Google's strategic narrative for Cloud

**Key Insights**:
1. **Strategic Narratives**: A strategy document shouldn't be a list of features. It should tell a story: "Here's the world we're in, here's where it's going, here's how we'll win."
2. **Narrative → Roadmap**: Once you have a narrative, the roadmap becomes the implementation plan for that story. Every roadmap item should trace back to a sentence in the narrative.
3. **Stakeholder Alignment**: When stakeholders disagree on the roadmap, go back to the narrative. "Which part of the story are you challenging?" changes the conversation from "my feature vs. your feature."

**Application to Roadmaps Product**:
> Enterprise PMs struggle with stakeholder alignment because they lack narrative framing:
> - Enable "strategic narrative" documents linked to roadmap items
> - Show traceability: roadmap item → strategic theme → narrative sentence
> - Include "narrative view" in stakeholder sharing (not just Gantt charts)
> - Support A/B testing narratives with small audiences before wide rollout

**Discussion Questions**:
1. How would you implement "strategic narrative" documents in Roadmaps product without creating yet another doc to maintain?
2. What traceability features would help PMs show roadmap-to-narrative alignment?

### Episode 6: How to make tough prioritization decisions - [Maggie Crowley](../lennys-podcast-transcripts/episodes/maggie-crowley/transcript.md)

> **Guest**: Maggie Crowley, Former Director of Product at Drift
> **YouTube**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9-QoMWZNyE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9-QoMWZNyE)
> **Relevance**: Maggie discusses how to make hard tradeoffs when everything seems important

**Key Timestamps**:
- `07:20` - The "only one bet" framework
- `18:00` - When to kill a roadmap darling
- `31:45` - Managing executive pet projects
- `44:30` - Saying "no" nicely but firmly

**Key Insights**:
1. **Only One Bet**: If you could only ship one thing this quarter, what would it be? Start there, then add 2-3 more. This forces focus instead of trying to do everything.
2. **Kill Your Darlings**: If a roadmap item has lingered for 3+ quarters without shipping, kill it. Either it's not important enough, or you don't have conviction—either way, remove it.
3. **Executive Pet Projects**: When an exec insists on their favorite feature, agree—but ask what gets cut to make room. Make the tradeoff explicit: "Yes, we can do X. That means Y and Z slip to next quarter. You good with that?"

**Application to Roadmaps Product**:
> Making tough tradeoffs visible is a superpower for enterprise PMs:
> - Support "priority 1 only" views to force tough choices
> - Flag roadmap items that have slipped multiple quarters (suggest killing)
> - Enable "what-if" scenarios: "If we add X, what slips?"
> - Track "requested by" to identify executive pet projects and their opportunity costs

**Discussion Questions**:
1. How would Roadmaps product help PMs have the "yes, but what gets cut?" conversation with executives?
2. What visualizations would make opportunity costs explicit and undeniable?

### Episode 7: How to prioritize when everything is important - [Jason Shah](../lennys-podcast-transcripts/episodes/jason-shah/transcript.md)

> **Guest**: Jason Shah, Former PM at Tinder and Product Lead at Etsy
> **YouTube**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79_DJzW2xpA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79_DJzW2xpA)
> **Relevance**: Jason discusses prioritization frameworks for high-growth environments with constant pressure

**Key Timestamps**:
- `05:15` - The Eisenhower Matrix for product decisions
- `16:30` - Urgent vs. Important: how to tell the difference
- `29:00` - Batch-processing similar decisions to avoid context switching
- `42:15` - Timeboxing roadmap reviews

**Key Insights**:
1. **Urgent ≠ Important**: Most PMs spend 80% of time on urgent-but-unimportant work. Map every roadmap request to urgent/important quadrants and prioritize accordingly.
2. **Batch Decisions**: Don't make prioritization decisions one by one as requests come in. Batch them: "Fridays at 2pm, I review all new requests and make decisions."
3. **Timebox Roadmap Reviews**: Infinite roadmap debates kill progress. Timebox roadmap reviews to 60 minutes. If you can't decide, the item defaults to "not now."

**Application to Roadmaps Product**:
> Enterprise PMs are drowning in urgent requests from sales, support, and executives:
> - Enable "inbox zero" for roadmap requests (collect, triage, batch process)
> - Support urgent/important tagging for incoming requests
> - Include timeboxing features for roadmap reviews
> - Provide default "not now" decisions with clear review criteria

**Discussion Questions**:
1. How would Roadmaps product help PMs batch-process roadmap requests instead of constant context switching?
2. What "request triage" workflows would reduce reactive firefighting?

### Episode 8: How to run a great roadmap review - [Matt LeMay](../lennys-podcast-transcripts/episodes/matt-lemay/transcript.md)

> **Guest**: Matt LeMay, Author of "Product Management in Practice" and Former PM at Bitly
> **YouTube**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hh5fLABG_Hg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hh5fLABG_Hg)
> **Relevance**: Matt shares practical tactics for running roadmap reviews that actually drive alignment

**Key Timestamps**:
- `08:45` - Pre-work for roadmap reviews (send materials early)
- `20:15` - The "no surprises" rule
- `33:30` - Handling roadmap debates in the moment
- `47:00` - Post-review follow-up that ensures alignment

**Key Insights**:
1. **No Surprises**: Never introduce a controversial roadmap item in the meeting itself. Socialize it 1:1 beforehand. The meeting is for alignment, not discovery.
2. **Decision Framework**: When debates stall, have a fallback framework: "We have 5 minutes to decide. If we can't agree, I'll decide as the PM. Here's my framework."
3. **Follow-Up Matters**: Send a summary email within 24 hours: "Here's what we decided, here's who owns what, here's when we'll review progress." Ambiguity kills alignment.

**Application to Roadmaps Product**:
> Roadmap reviews are where alignment lives or dies for enterprise teams:
> - Support "pre-read" distribution with comments/annotations
> - Enable "socialization mode" for gathering feedback before formal reviews
> - Include "decision frameworks" as templates (e.g., RICE, Cost of Delay)
> - Auto-generate follow-up summaries with action items and owners

**Discussion Questions**:
1. How would Roadmaps product enforce the "no surprises" rule?
2. What socialization workflows would help PMs gather feedback before formal reviews?

## Synthesis: Cross-Episode Themes

### Theme 1: Great Roadmaps Are Stories, Not Backlogs
**What the experts agree on**: Every guest emphasized that a roadmap isn't a list of features—it's a narrative about how you'll win. Ken Norton's "strategic narrative" framework, Elena Verna's vision-strategy-roadmap hierarchy, and Ian McAllister's emphasis on storytelling all point to the same truth: stakeholders buy into stories, not backlogs.

**Application to Planview Roadmaps**:
- The product should enable narrative-driven roadmaps, not just Gantt charts
- Strategic themes and business outcomes should be first-class, not afterthoughts
- Roadmap sharing should look like a business presentation, not a project plan

**Key Quotes**:
> "A strategy document shouldn't be a list of features. It should tell a story." — Ken Norton

> "Executives don't want to see your backlog—they want to see the narrative." — Ian McAllister

### Theme 2: Tradeoffs Must Be Explicit, Not Implicit
**What the experts agree on**: Maggie Crowley, Shreyas Doshi, and Gibson Biddle all highlighted that the biggest prioritization mistake is hiding tradeoffs. When you say "yes" to everything, you're saying "no" to everything—just implicitly. Great PMs make opportunity costs visible.

**Application to Planview Roadmaps**:
- Support "what-if" scenarios that show what slips when new items are added
- Track requested-by attribution to show whose pet project is delaying what
- Enable "priority 1 only" views to force tough choices

**Key Quotes**:
> "Every roadmap item you say 'yes' to means saying 'no' to something else. Make tradeoffs explicit." — Shreyas Doshi

> "Yes, we can do X. That means Y and Z slip. You good with that?" — Maggie Crowley

### Theme 3: Strategy > Tactics, But Tactics > Nothing
**What the experts agree on**: Ian McAllister's 50/30/20 rule (50% strategic, 30% tactical, 20% team building) revealed that most PMs have this backwards. Shreyas Doshi's "three levels of product work" and Elena Verna's vision-strategy-roadmap framework all reinforce that strategic thinking drives better roadmaps—but Jason Shah's batch-processing tactics show you still need execution.

**Application to Planview Roadmaps**:
- Enable "strategic view" that hides tactical noise
- Support executive-friendly roadmaps with business outcomes
- Include tactical workflows for request triage and batch processing

**Key Quotes**:
> "Most PMs spend 50% on tactics and 20% on strategy. It should be reversed." — Ian McAllister

> "Most execution problems are really strategy problems." — Shreyas Doshi

## Action Plan: Applying This to Your Work

### Week 1: Audit Your Current Roadmap Practice
- [ ] **Map your roadmap to the vision-strategy-roadmap framework**: Where are the gaps?
- [ ] **Run a pre-mortem** on your top 3 roadmap initiatives: "It's 6 months from now and this failed. Why?"
- [ ] **Identify implicit tradeoffs**: What have you said "yes" to without saying "no" to something else?
- **Output**: A 1-page assessment of your current roadmap practice with 3 specific improvements

### Week 2: Apply One Framework End-to-End
- [ ] **Choose a framework**: RICE (Biddle), Opportunity Scoring (Verna), or Cost of Delay
- [ ] **Apply it to your next roadmap planning cycle**: Don't just think about it—actually score items
- [ ] **Socialize controversial items 1:1** before the formal roadmap review (LeMay's "no surprises" rule)
- **Output**: A prioritized roadmap for next quarter with clear rationale for every item

### Week 3: Make the Story Explicit
- [ ] **Write a strategic narrative**: 2-3 pages that tell the story of how you'll win (Norton's framework)
- [ ] **Map every roadmap item to the narrative**: Which sentence does this item support?
- [ ] **Run a roadmap review focused on the narrative**: "Here's our story, here's how the roadmap delivers it"
- **Output**: A strategic narrative document that can stand alone and a roadmap that traces back to it
