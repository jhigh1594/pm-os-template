# Prioritization & Decision Making - Learning Path

> Curated episodes for Sr. PMs who need to master prioritization frameworks, make difficult tradeoffs under uncertainty, and build prioritization muscle across their organizations. **Portable skills that apply across any product or role.**

## Learning Objectives

After completing this learning path, you will be able to:

1. **Apply prioritization frameworks effectively** - Use RICE, Cost of Delay, Opportunity Scoring, and other frameworks to make data-driven prioritization decisions
2. **Make difficult tradeoffs under uncertainty** - Navigate situations where everything seems important and resources are constrained
3. **Manage stakeholder requests and executive pet projects** - Say no with data and diplomacy while preserving relationships
4. **Build prioritization culture across your organization** - Create transparent decision-making processes that teams trust
5. **Balance data-driven decisions with gut feel and vision** - Know when to trust data, when to trust intuition, and how to combine both

## Prerequisites

- **Knowledge**: Basic understanding of product management and prioritization concepts
- **Experience**: 3+ years in product roles, currently facing prioritization challenges
- **Time**: 4 hours (7 episodes × 30-35 minutes focused listening)

**Career Focus**: Prioritization is your daily strategic practice. The Sr. PMs who advance to Director and VP roles are the ones who make good prioritization decisions consistently and can explain their reasoning to stakeholders.

## Curated Episodes

### Episode 1: 35 Years of Product Design Wisdom - [Gibson Biddle](../lennys-podcast-transcripts/episodes/gibson-biddle/transcript.md)

> **Guest**: Gibson Biddle, Former VP Product at Netflix, Chegg, and TripAdvisor
> **YouTube**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGyOYVRgdAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGyOYVRgdAM)
> **Relevance**: Gibson shares the Delighters Framework and other prioritization approaches from his time scaling Netflix

**Key Timestamps**:
- `07:30` - The Delighters Framework explained
- `23:45` - Prioritization at Netflix: what worked
- `39:15` - RICE framework and beyond
- `54:00` - Making tough tradeoffs at scale
- `1:09:30` - Building prioritization culture

**Key Insights**:
1. **The Delighters Framework**: Categorize features into (1) Baseline expectations (table stakes—must have), (2) Delighters (differentiators that wow customers), (3) Duds (effort with no payoff). Prioritize Delighters first, then Baseline expectations. Never build Duds.
2. **RICE is a Starting Point, Not the Answer**: RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) is useful for getting started, but it has limitations. It doesn't account for strategic importance, dependencies, or risk. Use RICE as input, then apply judgment based on context.
3. **Prioritization is About Saying No**: The most important prioritization skill is saying no to good ideas that don't align with your strategy. Every yes is a no to something else. Make those tradeoffs explicit.

**Practice This Skill**:
> **Delighters Audit**: Take your current roadmap. Categorize each item as Baseline expectation, Delighter, or potential Dud. Are you investing in the right categories? Be honest—are you building Duds?

**Discussion Questions**:
1. What's the most common category on your roadmap: Baseline expectations, Delighters, or Duds?
2. When was the last time you said no to a good idea? What framework did you use to decide?

### Episode 2: The Art of Product Management - [Shreyas Doshi](../lennys-podcast-transcripts/episodes/shreyas-doshi/transcript.md)

> **Guest**: Shreyas Doshi, Product Leader at Stripe, Twitter, Google, Yahoo
> **YouTube**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Lk2qWFZwVs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Lk2qWFZwVs)
> **Relevance**: Shreyas shares prioritization pitfalls and how to avoid them

**Key Timestamps**:
- `12:30` - Prioritization pitfalls PMs make
- `28:15` - Strategic vs. tactical prioritization
- `45:00` - When everything seems important
- `58:45` - Data-driven vs. gut-feel decisions
- `1:14:20` - Building prioritization muscle

**Key Insights**:
1. **The trap of prioritizing by urgency**: When everything is urgent, nothing is strategic. Great PMs distinguish between urgent (fires, deadlines) and important (moves the needle on key metrics). Prioritize important over urgent, even when it feels uncomfortable.
2. **Strategic prioritization first**: Before prioritizing features, prioritize problems. What are the 2-3 most important problems to solve? Once you're clear on problems, feature prioritization becomes easier. If you're struggling to prioritize features, you probably haven't prioritized problems.
3. **Data informs, intuition decides**: Use data to narrow options and inform your thinking. But at the end of the day, you'll need to make a judgment call based on incomplete information. Prioritization frameworks are tools, not oracles.

**Practice This Skill**:
> **Strategic Problem Prioritization**: List all the problems your product could solve. Now prioritize that list down to the top 3. What criteria did you use? Are you solving the right problems, or just the loudest ones?

**Discussion Questions**:
1. What are the top 3 problems your product should solve? Can your team articulate them clearly?
2. When was the last time you prioritized important over urgent? How did it feel?

### Episode 3: Mastering Product Strategy - [Maggie Crowley](../lennys-podcast-transcripts/episodes/maggie-crowley/transcript.md)

> **Guest**: Maggie Crowley, Former Director of Product at Drift and TripAdvisor
> **YouTube**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZYpCeMR-XU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZYpCeMR-XU)
> **Relevance**: Maggie shares how to make tough tradeoff decisions and communicate them to stakeholders

**Key Timestamps**:
- `06:45` - The reality of resource constraints
- `22:30` - Making tough tradeoffs
- `38:15` - Opportunity cost thinking
- `52:00` - Communicating tradeoffs to stakeholders
- `1:06:30` - Living with your prioritization decisions

**Key Insights**:
1. **Opportunity Cost is Real**: Every decision to do X is a decision not to do Y, Z, and Q. Great PMs make opportunity costs explicit. "If we do this project, we're delaying these three other projects." Transparency about tradeoffs builds trust.
2. **Tradeoff Framework for Stakeholders**: When stakeholders push for their projects, use this framework: "Here's what we're currently prioritizing. If we add your project, what would you like us to deprioritize? Same timeline or more scope?" Make the tradeoff their choice.
3. **Live with Your Decisions**: Once you prioritize, commit. Don't constantly revisit decisions unless new information emerges. Constant re-prioritization destroys trust and momentum. Make the best call you can, then stick with it long enough to see results.

**Practice This Skill**:
> **Opportunity Cost Mapping**: For your current top 3 initiatives, map what you're not doing because of those choices. Can you articulate those tradeoffs clearly to stakeholders?

**Discussion Questions**:
1. What are you currently not doing because of your prioritization choices? Can you articulate those tradeoffs?
2. How do you handle stakeholders who want to reprioritize constantly?

### Episode 4: The One Question That Saves Product Careers - [Matt LeMay](../lennys-podcast-transcripts/episodes/matt-lemay/transcript.md)

> **Guest**: Matt LeMay, Product Author and Consultant
> **YouTube**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DprYcCtqG6s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DprYcCtqG6s)
> **Relevance**: Matt shares the one question that clarifies prioritization decisions and saves PMs from building the wrong things

**Key Timestamps**:
- `04:30` - The one question that changes everything
- `19:45` - When RICE doesn't work
- `35:15` - Prioritization in ambiguity
- `50:00` - Saying no without burning bridges
- `1:04:30` - Building your prioritization intuition

**Key Insights**:
1. **The One Question**: "What problem are we trying to solve?" Before prioritizing solutions, clarify the problem. If the team can't agree on the problem, prioritization will be impossible. Agreement on the problem makes prioritization straightforward.
2. **When Frameworks Fail**: RICE and other frameworks work when you have clear data and well-defined problems. But in early-stage products or ambiguous situations, frameworks break down. In these cases, prioritize based on risk reduction and learning. What will we learn? What risk will this mitigate?
3. **Saying No is a Skill**: Learn to say no gracefully. "I love this idea and want to do it justice. Given our current commitments, I can't give it the attention it deserves right now. Can we revisit this next quarter?" This validates their idea while holding your ground.

**Practice This Skill**:
> **Problem Clarity Check**: For your top 3 roadmap items, articulate the problem each solves. Are they clear? Does the team agree? If not, clarify the problem before prioritizing the solution.

**Discussion Questions**:
1. For your current roadmap, can you articulate the problem each item solves?
2. How do you handle prioritization when data is scarce and the situation is ambiguous?

### Episode 5: Building a Meaningful Career - [Jason Shah](../lennys-podcast-transcripts/episodes/jason-shah/transcript.md)

> **Guest**: Jason Shah, Former PM at Airbnb, Amazon, Microsoft
> **YouTube**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVkEY4P6QOQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVkEY4P6QOQ)
> **Relevance**: Jason shares how to manage incoming requests and protect your team's focus

**Key Timestamps**:
- `11:30` - Managing the flood of incoming requests
- `27:15` - Protecting team focus
- `43:00` - Triage frameworks for requests
- `58:45` - Building your prioritization system
- `1:13:30` - When to escalate prioritization decisions

**Key Insights**:
1. **Triage Every Request**: Not all requests are created equal. Create a simple triage system: (1) Quick wins (low effort, high impact—do immediately), (2) Major projects (high effort, high impact—plan carefully), (3) Fill-ins (low effort, low impact—do when there's downtime), (4) Money pits (high effort, low impact—never do).
2. **Protect Your Team's Focus**: Constant reprioritization destroys team morale and velocity. Once you've committed to a roadmap, protect it for at least a quarter. Accumulate new requests and revisit them in the next planning cycle. This builds trust and enables focus.
3. **Build Your Prioritization System**: Don't reinvent prioritization every time. Build a system: clear criteria, documented framework, transparent process, regular review cycles. When the system is clear, stakeholders trust the process even when they don't love the outcome.

**Practice This Skill**:
> **Triage System Audit**: Create a simple triage system for incoming requests. Map the last 10 requests you received against the four quadrants. How many quick wins did you miss? How many money pits did you avoid?

**Discussion Questions**:
1. How do you triage incoming requests? Do you have a system, or is it ad-hoc?
2. How often do you reprioritize? Is it protecting focus or destroying momentum?

### Episode 6: What It Takes to Become a Top 1% PM - [Ian McAllister](../lennys-podcast-transcripts/episodes/ian-mcallister/transcript.md)

> **Guest**: Ian McAllister, Former Director of Product at Uber, Amazon, and Airbnb
> **YouTube**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOHLfBnBYnY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOHLfBnBYnY)
> **Relevance**: Ian shares how top PMs think about prioritization and strategic decisions

**Key Timestamps**:
- `14:45` - Prioritization at Amazon vs. Uber vs. Airbnb
- `31:30` - The Working Backwards framework
- `48:00` - Data-driven prioritization
- `1:03:15` - When to break your own rules
- `1:18:00` - Building prioritization muscle memory

**Key Insights**:
1. **Working Backwards from Customer Value**: Amazon's "Working Backwards" framework starts with the customer value proposition, then works backward to features. If you can't articulate customer value clearly, don't build it. This clarifies prioritization by forcing you to justify every project in customer terms.
2. **Data + Judgment = Good Decisions**: Top PMs use data to inform decisions, but they're not slaves to data. When data conflicts with strong customer insight or strategic judgment, they pause and investigate. Sometimes the data is wrong. Sometimes the customer insight is wrong. Understand why they conflict.
3. **Prioritization Muscle Memory**: The best prioritizers have developed intuition through thousands of decisions. They can quickly assess opportunity size, effort, risk, and strategic fit. This isn't magic—it's practice. Make lots of decisions, reflect on what worked, and build your muscle memory.

**Practice This Skill**:
> **Working Backwards Exercise**: For your top 3 roadmap items, write a one-paragraph customer value proposition. If you can't articulate customer value clearly, why are you building it?

**Discussion Questions**:
1. For your current roadmap, can you articulate the customer value proposition for each item?
2. When was the last time data and customer insight conflicted? How did you resolve it?

### Episode 7: Product Discovery and Opportunity Solution Trees - [Teresa Torres](../lennys-podcast-transcripts/episodes/teresa-torres/transcript.md)

> **Guest**: Teresa Torres, Author of "Continuous Discovery Habits"
> **YouTube**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO1vBJKBGvY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO1vBJKBGvY)
> **Relevance**: Teresa shares how to prioritize using opportunity solution trees instead of feature lists

**Key Timestamps**:
- `09:15` - Prioritizing opportunities, not features
- `25:45` - Opportunity solution trees for prioritization
- `42:00` - When to use frameworks vs. when to use judgment
- `58:30` - Testing assumptions before prioritizing
- `1:13:15` - Building a prioritization system your team trusts

**Key Insights**:
1. **Prioritize Opportunities, Not Features**: Instead of prioritizing features (solutions), prioritize opportunities (problems worth solving). Map opportunity solution trees: desired outcome → opportunities to achieve it → solutions to pursue. This clarifies what matters and why.
2. **Test Assumptions Before Committing**: Before prioritizing a solution for build, test the key assumptions. Will users understand this? Will they value it? Can we actually build it? Quick tests prevent wasted work on solutions that won't work. Prioritize based on learning, not just speculation.
3. **Transparent Process Builds Trust**: When stakeholders understand your prioritization process, they trust the outcomes even when they disagree. Document your criteria. Share your thinking. Explain the tradeoffs. Transparency reduces lobbying and second-guessing.

**Practice This Skill**:
> **Opportunity Solution Tree**: Pick one key outcome. Map 5-7 opportunities to achieve it. For each opportunity, list 2-3 solutions. For each solution, list 2-3 assumptions. Now prioritize based on which opportunities matter most and which assumptions you should test first.

**Discussion Questions**:
1. Do you prioritize opportunities (problems) or solutions (features)? What would change if you flipped your approach?
2. How transparent is your prioritization process? Do stakeholders understand why you make the decisions you do?

## Synthesis: Cross-Episode Themes

### Theme 1: Prioritization is About Saying No

**What the experts agree on**: Gibson Biddle, Shreyas Doshi, and Maggie Crowley all emphasize that the most important prioritization skill is saying no to good ideas that don't align with your strategy.

**Portable Skill**: Before saying yes to any new request, ask: "What problem does this solve? Is it one of our top 3 problems? If we do this, what don't we do?" Make the tradeoff explicit.

**Career Application**: Directors and VPs are hired for their prioritization judgment—their ability to focus on what matters and say no to everything else. Practice saying no clearly, diplomatically, and consistently.

**Key Quotes**:
> "Every yes is a no to something else. Make those tradeoffs explicit." — Maggie Crowley

> "Strategy is about saying no to good ideas that don't align." — Shreyas Doshi

### Theme 2: Data Informs, Judgment Decides

**What the experts agree on**: Shreyas Doshi, Ian McAllister, and Teresa Torres all reinforce that frameworks and data are tools, not oracles. At the end of the day, prioritization requires human judgment.

**Portable Skill**: Use data to narrow options and inform thinking. Then make a judgment call based on the full context: strategy, customer insight, risk, resource constraints, and organizational politics. Frameworks support good decisions—they don't replace them.

**Career Application**: As you advance to Director and VP roles, you'll have less data and more ambiguity. Your judgment—honed through practice and reflection—becomes your most valuable asset.

**Key Quotes**:
> "Data informs, intuition decides. Use data as input, not output." — Shreyas Doshi

> "Prioritization frameworks are tools, not oracles." — Ian McAllister

### Theme 3: Transparent Process Builds Trust

**What the experts agree on**: Jason Shah, Teresa Torres, and Ian McAllister all emphasize that stakeholders trust prioritization outcomes when they understand the process.

**Portable Skill**: Make your prioritization system transparent: clear criteria, documented framework, regular review cycles, explicit tradeoffs. When stakeholders see the thinking, they trust the outcome even when they disagree.

**Career Application**: Directors and VPs must build organization-wide trust in prioritization decisions. A transparent, consistent process is how you scale trust across hundreds of stakeholders.

**Key Quotes**:
> "Transparent process reduces lobbying and second-guessing." — Teresa Torres

> "When stakeholders understand your process, they trust the outcomes." — Jason Shah

## Action Plan: Applying This to Your Work

### Week 1: Audit Your Prioritization System
- [ ] **Map your current process**: How do you currently prioritize? What criteria do you use? How transparent is the process? Do stakeholders trust it?
- [ ] **Problem clarity check**: For your top 5 roadmap items, articulate the problem each solves. Are they clear? Does the team agree?
- [ ] **Identify your trap**: What's your most common prioritization pitfall? Urgency over importance? Framework over-reliance? Constant re-prioritization? Identify one trap to address.
- **Output**: Clear understanding of your current prioritization system and one area to improve

### Week 2: Apply (or Refine) Your Framework
- [ ] **Choose your framework**: Pick one framework (RICE, Delighters, Opportunity Solution Trees) and apply it consistently for two weeks. Don't mix frameworks—commit to one.
- [ ] **Document your criteria**: Write down the criteria you're using. What counts as high impact? What counts as low effort? Make your thinking explicit.
- [ ] **Share with stakeholders**: Share your prioritization with stakeholders, including the tradeoffs. "Here's what we're prioritizing and why. Here's what we're not doing."
- **Output**: A consistent, documented prioritization approach that stakeholders understand

### Week 3: Build Your Prioritization Muscle
- [ ] **Practice saying no**: This week, say no to three requests that don't align with your top 3 problems. Use the tradeoff framework: "If we do this, what don't we do?"
- [ ] **Reflect on decisions**: For every prioritization decision you make, write down: What did I decide? Why? What assumptions am I making? Review weekly to build your intuition.
- [ ] **Protect team focus**: Commit to your current roadmap for at least a month. Accumulate new requests for the next planning cycle. Give your team the space to execute.
- **Output**: Stronger prioritization muscle and a team that trusts you to protect their focus

## Career Progression: From Sr. PM to VP Product

**Prioritization is your daily strategic practice.** Here's how prioritization skills scale with seniority:

| Skill | Sr. PM | Director | VP Product |
|-------|--------|----------|------------|
| Scope | Features for one product | Product line roadmap | Entire portfolio strategy |
| Framework | RICE, impact/effort | Custom frameworks for context | Portfolio allocation models |
| Stakeholders | Team and immediate stakeholders | Multiple functions and leaders | Executives, board, external |
| Tradeoffs | Feature-level tradeoffs | Product-level tradeoffs | Business-level tradeoffs (build vs. buy vs. partner) |

**Your path to VP**:
1. **Sr. PM**: Master prioritization frameworks. Make good decisions consistently. Explain your reasoning clearly.
2. **Director**: Prioritize across multiple products. Design portfolio frameworks. Balance competing stakeholder interests.
3. **VP**: Prioritize at the business level. Make allocation decisions across the entire product portfolio. Build company-wide trust in your prioritization judgment.

**Start now**: The prioritization judgment you develop as a Sr. PM is the foundation for Director and VP roles. Every prioritization decision is practice for the next level. Make lots of decisions, reflect on what worked, and build your muscle memory.
