# 📦 Products Directory

Product strategy, ICPs, ROI frameworks, and feature specifications.

## Structure

Each product has its own subdirectory:

```
📦 Products/
├── {{PRODUCT_1}}/
│   ├── README.md           # Product overview
│   ├── ICP.md              # Ideal Customer Profile
│   ├── ROI-framework.md    # Value proposition and ROI
│   ├── competitive/        # Competitive positioning
│   ├── designs/            # Design mockups and specs
│   └── initiatives/        # Feature specs and PRDs
├── {{PRODUCT_2}}/
└── {{PRODUCT_3}}/
```

## Usage
