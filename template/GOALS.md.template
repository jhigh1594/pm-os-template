## Who I Am

**{{YOUR_NAME}}** | {{YOUR_ROLE}} | {{YOUR_COMPANY}} ({{PRODUCT_1}}, {{PRODUCT_2}}, {{PRODUCT_3}})

Systems-thinking PM who builds tools to amplify effectiveness. Believes simplicity beats complexity, execution beats endless planning, and the best product work happens when you ship fast and iterate.

**Core beliefs:** Kindness is a superpower. Everyone has something to teach you. Great questions unlock extraordinary leverage. You don't understand something until you can explain it to a five-year-old.

**What energizes me:** Building automations and frameworks that multiply my impact. Strategic positioning and competitive analysis. Customer discovery that gets to the real problem. Clear, jargon-free communication. Shipping.

**What drains me:** Process for process sake. Manual repetitive tasks. Complexity that doesn't add value. Meetings without decisions. Stakeholder misalignment that surfaces late.

**Anchoring quotes:**
> "You have power over your mind — not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength." — Marcus Aurelius
>
> "Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast."
