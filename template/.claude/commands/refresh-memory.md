Update `memory-bank/memory.md` with session activity by running the memory updater script.

## Command Arguments

Parse the command arguments in order:
1. **Dry Run** (optional, default: `false`): `true` or `false`
   - `true`: Show what would be updated without writing
   - `false`: Update memory.md with session activity

## Execution

Build the command based on arguments:
- Base command: `python3 scripts/automation/memory_updater.py`
- If `dry_run` is `true`, add `--dry-run`

Run the command using Bash.

## How It Works

The `memory_updater.py` script:
1. Reads session intent from `.aipmos/session-intent.json`
2. Fetches git commits since session start
3. Creates a formatted session entry
4. Appends to memory.md in the correct location
5. Runs memory maintainer to prevent bloat

## Session Entry Format

Entries are added to memory.md in this format:

```markdown
### [January 27, 2026] Session: Implement /brainstorm command
**Context**: Create persona-based brainstorming command for tactical pre-PRD exploration
**Planned**: Implement /brainstorm command with PM, Designer, and Engineer personas
**Completed**:
- Create /brainstorm command with three persona files
- Add command to COMMAND-REFERENCE.md
**Outcome**: Planned to: Implement /brainstorm command | Completed: feature development, documentation | Changes: 3 feature, 2 doc commits
```

---

## Session Intent Setup

The script reads from `.aipmos/session-intent.json`:

```json
{
  "intent": "Implement /brainstorm command",
  "user_description": "Create persona-based brainstorming with three expert perspectives",
  "start_time": "2026-01-27T08:00:00Z"
}
```

Session intent is typically set via:
- `/today` command (daily planning workflow)
- Manual edit of `.aipmos/session-intent.json`
- Future: Intent detection from conversational context

---

## Memory Maintainer

After updating memory.md, the script automatically runs `memory_maintainer.py` to:
- Prevent memory file bloat
- Archive old session entries
- Consolidate redundant information
- Maintain performance

---

## Integration Points

**Triggered by**:
- End of work session (manual invocation)
- Before `/check-progress` (to ensure current memory state)
- After significant feature completion

**Complements**:
- `/check-progress` - Shows deltas since last memory update
- `/today` - Sets session intent that this command reads

---

## Usage Pattern

Typical workflow:

1. **Start session**: Set intent via `/today` or manual edit
2. **Do work**: Make commits, create files
3. **Run `/refresh-memory`**: Capture session in memory.md
4. **Continue**: Repeat as needed

---

## Output

Success message:
```
✅ Updated memory.md with session: Implement /brainstorm command...
   File: ./memory-bank/memory.md (relative to workspace root)
   Commits: 5
```

---

## Notes

- If no session intent exists, falls back to git commits only
- No commits = records as planning/research session
- Entries are inserted after "Current Focus" section
- "Last Updated" timestamp is automatically updated
