# Company Context Onboarding

## Phase 1: Days 1-30 (LEARN)

**Goal**: Build comprehensive context fast through structured discovery.

### Week 1: Company & Product Foundations

**Learn the Company**:
- [ ] **Mission/Vision/Values**: What does the company stand for?
- [ ] **Business Model**: How do we make money?
- [ ] **Strategy**: Where are we going? What are the big bets?
- [ ] **Metrics**: What numbers matter most? (North Star, KPIs)
- [ ] **Competitive Landscape**: Who are we competing with? How are we differentiated?
- [ ] **Team Structure**: Who does what? Who are the key decision makers?

**Learn the Product**:
- [ ] **Use the product** (spend 4+ hours as a customer)
- [ ] **Product architecture** (how does it work technically?)
- [ ] **Customer segments** (who uses this and why?)
- [ ] **Core value proposition** (what problem do we solve?)
- [ ] **Product metrics** (adoption, engagement, retention, revenue)
- [ ] **Roadmap** (what's being built, what's planned?)

**Key Questions to Ask**:
1. What's the most important thing the company needs to achieve this year?
2. What are the biggest challenges/risks we face?
3. Who are our most successful customers and why do they love us?
4. Who are our competitors and how are we different?
5. What did the last PM do well? What could have been better?

**Who to Meet** (schedule 30-min 1:1s):
- [ ] Your manager (understand expectations, priorities, success criteria)
- [ ] Cross-functional partners (Engineering lead, Design lead)
- [ ] Peer PMs (learn from their experience)
- [ ] Go-to-market (Sales, Marketing, Support leaders)
- [ ] Leadership (CEO, Head of Product if accessible)

### Week 2: Customer & Market Deep Dive

**Talk to Customers** (5-10 interviews):
- [ ] **Power users**: What makes them successful?
- [ ] **New users**: How's the onboarding experience?
- [ ] **Churned users**: Why did they leave?
- [ ] **Target prospects**: Why haven't they bought yet?

**Customer Interview Questions**:
1. Tell me about your role and what you're trying to accomplish.
2. How do you use [Product] today? Walk me through your workflow.
3. What do you love about it? What frustrates you?
4. If you could wave a magic wand and change one thing, what would it be?
5. What alternatives did you consider? Why did you choose us?

**Analyze the Market**:
- [ ] Read analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester if available)
- [ ] Review competitor products (sign up for trials, use them)
- [ ] Read customer reviews on G2, Capterra (what do they say?)
- [ ] Study industry trends (where is the market going?)

### Week 3-4: Data & Systems Mastery

**Master the Data**:
- [ ] Set up analytics access (Mixpanel, Amplitude, Looker, etc.)
- [ ] Review key dashboards (product metrics, funnels, cohorts)
- [ ] Understand top funnels (where do users drop off?)
- [ ] Analyze retention cohorts (are we getting better over time?)
- [ ] Review support tickets (top complaints, feature requests)

**Understand the Systems**:
- [ ] Product development process (how do we build?)
- [ ] Decision-making process (who decides what?)
- [ ] Planning process (roadmap, sprint planning, OKRs)
- [ ] Launch process (how do we ship features?)
- [ ] Tools and workflows (Jira, Figma, Slack conventions, etc.)

**Document What You're Learning**:
Create a "Company Context" doc with:
- Mission, strategy, business model
- Customer segments and use cases
- Product architecture and key metrics
- Competitive landscape
- Key people and decision-making
- Top opportunities and challenges you've identified

## Phase 2: Days 31-60 (CONTRIBUTE)

**Goal**: Ship small wins and build credibility.

### Find Your Quick Wins

**Characteristics of good quick wins**:
- ✅ Valuable to customers (not just busywork)
- ✅ Shippable in 2-4 weeks (fast feedback)
- ✅ Low risk (won't break anything critical)
- ✅ Visible (stakeholders will notice)
- ✅ Builds relationships (work with engineering, design, etc.)

**Examples of quick wins**:
- Fix top usability issue identified in customer interviews
- Ship small feature requested by multiple customers
- Improve onboarding flow based on data analysis
- Clean up confusing UI/copy
- Create better documentation for confused users
- Implement analytics to measure blind spot

**How to find quick wins**:
1. Review support tickets → What are top complaints?
2. Talk to engineering → What "paper cut" bugs annoy everyone?
3. Analyze data → What obvious drop-off could we fix?
4. Ask sales/CS → What small feature would help close deals?

### Build Relationships

**Invest in 1:1s**:
- [ ] Engineering team (understand their priorities, constraints)
- [ ] Design (learn their process, collaboration style)
- [ ] Data/Analytics (who can help with analysis?)
- [ ] Sales/CS (what do they need from product?)
- [ ] Marketing (how do they position the product?)

**Relationship-building tips**:
- Ask how they like to work (communication preferences, meeting cadence)
- Offer to help them (don't just extract value)
- Follow through on commitments (build trust early)
- Give credit generously (acknowledge contributions)
- Be curious, not judgmental (especially about past decisions)

### Start Contributing to Strategy

**Bring fresh perspective**:
- You have "beginner's mind" - use it
- Question assumptions (respectfully)
- Share what you're learning from customers
- Propose ideas (even if they're rough)
- Contribute to planning discussions

**Don't**:
- Criticize past decisions (you don't have full context yet)
- Push major changes (earn trust first)
- Assume you know better than people who've been here longer

## Phase 3: Days 61-90 (LEAD)

**Goal**: Own meaningful initiatives and drive impact.

### Own a Meaningful Initiative

**Characteristics of good 60-90 day initiatives**:
- ✅ Strategic importance (aligned with company priorities)
- ✅ Clear customer value (validated through discovery)
- ✅ Shippable in 6-8 weeks (with team's capacity)
- ✅ Demonstrates your skills (strategic thinking, execution, collaboration)

**Example initiatives**:
- Ship new feature that moves key metric
- Launch improved onboarding that increases activation
- Execute competitive response to market threat
- Define and socialize product strategy for your area
- Establish new process that improves team effectiveness

### Demonstrate Full PM Skill Set

**By day 90, you should have shown**:

- ✅ **Collaboration**: Work effectively across functions
- ✅ **Communication**: Influence through clear, compelling communication
- ✅ **Data-driven**: Use data to inform decisions and measure impact
- ✅ **Leadership**: Drive alignment and inspire team

### Reflect and Adjust

**90-Day Self-Assessment**:
1. What have I learned about the company, product, customers?
2. What have I shipped? What impact did it have?
3. What relationships have I built?
4. Where am I adding the most value?
5. Where do I need to grow or improve?
6. What should I focus on in the next 90 days?

**Get Feedback**:
- [ ] Ask your manager for 90-day review
- [ ] Ask peers and cross-functional partners for feedback
- [ ] Reflect on what's working and what's not

## Constraints

- Don't try to change everything on day 1 (earn trust first)
- Don't criticize past decisions without understanding full context
- Don't skip talking to customers (they have the answers)
- Don't work in isolation (build relationships early)
- Don't wait to ship (find quick wins in first 30-60 days)
- Don't assume you know better (you have fresh eyes, not perfect information)

## Mental Models Applied

- **Question Behind the Question**: What do I really need to learn here?
- **Time Value of Shipping**: Ship small wins early to build credibility
- **Feedback Loops**: Learn → Ship → Learn faster
- **Working Backwards**: What does success look like at 90 days? Work back from there

## Integration with Other Commands

- Use **/research** to plan customer interview questions
- Use **/think** to process what you're learning strategically
- Use **/compete** to understand competitive landscape
- Use **/decide** when prioritizing quick wins
- Use **/write** to document your learning (context docs, summaries)
