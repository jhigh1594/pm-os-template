# B2B Product Launch Execution

End-to-end launch execution for B2B SaaS products—from positioning to sales enablement to metrics.

## When This Skill Activates

Use this skill when:
- Launching new features or products
- Creating go-to-market materials
- Building sales enablement (demo scripts, talk tracks, objection handling)
- Planning internal enablement (CS, support, sales briefings)
- Defining launch tiers and resource allocation
- Measuring launch success

## Launch Philosophy

**Every launch answers three questions:**
1. **Who cares?** (Target audience and their pain)
2. **Why now?** (Urgency and timing)
3. **Why us?** (Differentiation and proof)

**Launch ≠ Release.** A release is code deployed. A launch is value communicated.

## Launch Tiers

Not all launches deserve equal investment. Match resources to impact.

| Tier | Criteria | Timeline | Owner |
|------|----------|----------|-------|
| **Tier 1** | Strategic bet, new product/market, exec visibility | 8-12 weeks | PM + PMM + Marketing |
| **Tier 2** | Major feature, competitive response, customer demand | 4-6 weeks | PM + PMM |
| **Tier 3** | Enhancement, iteration, minor capability | 1-2 weeks | PM |

**See `launch-tiers.md` for detailed tier definitions and requirements.**

## Core Frameworks

### 1. Positioning Canvas (April Dunford)

```markdown
# Positioning: [Feature/Product]

## 1. Best For (Target Customer)
**Ideal customer:**
- Role: [specific role]
- Company: [size, industry, stage]
- Pain: [specific problem they have]

**NOT for:** [who should avoid]

## 2. Category
**It's a:** [category name]
**Context:** [how customers understand it]
**Analogy:** "[Product] is like [familiar thing] for [new context]"

## 3. Alternatives
**Customers currently use:**
- [Alternative 1]: [why it's insufficient]
- [Alternative 2]: [why it's insufficient]
- [Alternative 3]: [why it's insufficient]

## 4. Unique Value
**We're different because:**
- [Differentiator 1]: [specific capability]
- [Differentiator 2]: [specific capability]

**Why that matters:**
- [Customer benefit 1]
- [Customer benefit 2]

## 5. Proof Points
- [Metric with context: "X% improvement in Y"]
- [Customer quote with name/title]
- [Case study link]

## One-Sentence Positioning
"For [target customer] who [need/problem], [product] is a [category] that [unique value]. Unlike [alternatives], we [key differentiator]."
```

### 2. Launch Announcement Structure

```markdown
# [Feature Name]: [One-line value prop]

## The Problem
[What pain does this solve? Be specific about the customer's world before.]

## The Solution
[How does this feature work? Focus on outcome, not mechanism.]

## Why It Matters
[Customer benefits, not features. Connect to business outcomes.]

## Get Started
[Clear next steps. Link to docs, video, or in-app guidance.]
```

## Sales Enablement

Sales needs more than announcements—they need tools to win deals.

**See `sales-enablement.md` for:**
- Demo scripts and flow
- Talk tracks by persona
- Objection handling guide
- ROI calculator template
- Competitive positioning
- Discovery questions

### Quick Reference: Sales One-Pager Template

```markdown
# [Feature Name] - Sales One-Pager

## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
[One-sentence positioning]

## Who It's For
- **Best fit:** [Ideal customer profile]
- **Trigger events:** [What's happening in their world]

## Key Benefits
1. [Benefit 1 with proof]
2. [Benefit 2 with proof]
3. [Benefit 3 with proof]

## Competitive Differentiation
| Capability | Us | [Competitor] |
|------------|-----|--------------|
| [Capability 1] | ✅ | ❌ |
| [Capability 2] | ✅ | ⚠️ Partial |

## Common Objections & Responses
**"We already use [alternative]."**
→ Response: [How to position against]

## Proof Points
- [Customer story]
- [Metric]

## Next Steps
- [Call to action for prospect]
```

## Internal Enablement

Don't launch to customers before your team is ready.

**See `internal-enablement.md` for:**
- Customer Success briefing template
- Support playbook template
- Engineering handoff template
- FAQ generation

### Quick Reference: Enablement Checklist by Team

| Team | What They Need | When |
|------|----------------|------|
| **Sales** | Demo script, talk track, objections, pricing | 2 weeks before |
| **CS** | Feature overview, customer impact, FAQ | 1 week before |
| **Support** | Troubleshooting guide, known issues, escalation | 1 week before |
| **Marketing** | Messaging, assets, proof points, quotes | 2 weeks before |

## Metrics Framework

Launch without metrics is just hope.

**See `metrics-framework.md` for:**
- Metric selection by launch tier
- Adoption tracking templates
- Leading vs lagging indicators
- Success/failure criteria

### Quick Reference: Tier-Based Metrics

## Key Quotes

**April Dunford:**
> "The best positioning makes it obvious who should buy, what they're buying, and why it matters."

**Brian Chesky:**
> "Every feature needs a story. If you can't tell a story about it, you can't launch it."

**Des Traynor:**
> "Launch is not a single moment. It's a sequence of moments that build on each other."
