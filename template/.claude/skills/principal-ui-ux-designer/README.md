## How to Use

### Getting Design Feedback

Simply ask for design feedback on your work:

```
"Can you review the UX for this feature: [paste spec or PRD]?"
"What do you think of this dashboard design: [paste description]?"
"Review the onboarding flow for: [describe flow]"
```

The skill will provide:
- Strengths of the current approach
- Concerns or potential issues
- Questions for clarification
- Specific recommendations with rationale

### Specific Design Guidance

Ask about specific topics:

```
"What's the best chart type for showing dependency relationships?"
"How should I design permissions for multi-tenant SaaS?"
"What are the accessibility considerations for this component?"
"How do I optimize activation for my onboarding flow?"
```

### Design Thinking Process

For structured design thinking work:

```
"Help me apply design thinking to: [describe problem]"
"Walk me through the empathy phase for: [user group]"
"I need to prototype and validate: [idea]. What methods should I use?"
```

## Key Concepts

### The Activation Equation
```
Activation = (Perceived Value / Effort Required) × Trust
```

### Design Thinking Stages
1. **Empathize**: Understand user needs deeply
2. **Define**: Frame the problem clearly
3. **Ideate**: Generate diverse solutions
4. **Prototype**: Make ideas tangible
5. **Test**: Validate with users

### Dashboard Design Principles
- Establish strong visual hierarchy
- Design around a single, clear goal
- Group related information (Gestalt principles)
- Provide context for every metric
- Enable drill-down for exploration

### Accessibility Non-Negotiables
- Color contrast 4.5:1 minimum
- All functionality keyboard accessible
- Never rely on color alone
- Clear focus indicators
- Screen reader compatible

## Examples

### Example 1: Dashboard Review
```
User: "Review this dashboard design: KPI cards at top showing
      revenue, MRR, and churn. Below that, line charts for trends.
      Data table at bottom with all transactions."

Skill: Provides detailed feedback on:
- Visual hierarchy (KPI first = correct)
- Chart selection (line charts good for trends)
- Information architecture (logical flow)
- Potential issues (data table may be overwhelming)
- Recommendations (filter, pagination, export)
```

### Example 2: Onboarding Optimization
```
User: "Our activation rate is only 30%. Users sign up but don't
      create their first project. Current flow: email verify →
      create account → 10-question survey → dashboard."

Skill: Analyzes friction points and recommends:
- Remove email verification before value (reduces friction)
- Cut survey to 3-5 questions (ask progressively)
- Add sample data option (immediate exploration)
- Guide to first project creation (clear value)
- Success metrics to track
```

### Example 3: Accessibility Review
```
User: "Is this color palette accessible? Primary blue #3B82F6,
      error red #EF4444, success green #10B981 on white background."

Skill: Checks contrast ratios and provides:
- Detailed contrast analysis for each color
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance assessment
- Recommendations for improvements
- Colorblind-safe alternatives
- Testing recommendations
```

## Philosophy

This skill embodies the principal designer mindset:

**User-Centricity**: Every decision starts with "who is this for and what problem does it solve?"

**Evidence-Based**: Design based on research, testing, and data—not opinions or trends.

**Clarity Over Complexity**: When principles conflict, favor clarity and simplicity.

**Accessibility First**: Inclusive design is a requirement, not an add-on.

**Iterative Design**: Prototype early, test often, learn faster.
