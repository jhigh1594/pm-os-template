# Pricing Intelligence (B2B SaaS)

Help Jon design pricing strategy, packaging, and value metrics for B2B SaaS products with evidence-based pricing intelligence.

## When This Skill Activates

Use this skill when Jon is:
- Making a pricing decision (new product, reprice, packaging change)
- Designing packaging tiers or add-on modules
- Selecting or validating a value metric
- Planning willingness-to-pay (WTP) research
- Setting discount guardrails or approval policy
- Analyzing competitor pricing models
- Building a migration path for existing customers
- Creating sales enablement for pricing conversations

## Core Workflow

Follow this 7-step process. Each step builds on the previous one, but Jon may enter at any step depending on what's already decided.

### Step 1: Clarify the Pricing Decision
- New product vs. reprice vs. packaging change
- Target segment(s), buyer persona(s), deal size band
- Contract model (monthly/annual, seat/usage/hybrid)
- Constraints (sales motion, procurement, churn risk, legal)

### Step 2: Build the Value Hypothesis
- Define the core job-to-be-done and value outcome
- Translate value into a measurable ROI model
- Identify the value metric that scales with customer value

### Step 3: Pricing Intelligence Collection
- **Competitors**: price model, packaging, fences, overage, enterprise deal patterns
- **Customers**: WTP signals, budget ranges, procurement objections, value proof
- **Sales/CS**: win/loss themes, discounting patterns, negotiation friction
- **Product/Usage**: feature adoption, cost-to-serve, expansion levers

### Step 4: WTP Research Plan
Pick 1-2 methods based on the decision context. See `wtp-research-methods.md` for detailed method guidance, sample questions, and selection criteria.

### Step 5: Packaging Architecture
Design tiers or modules with clear value fences. See `packaging-architecture.md` for patterns, anti-patterns, and design heuristics.

### Step 6: Price Point & Policy
- Recommended list price band + rationale
- Discount guardrails (floors, approval triggers)
- Migration path for existing customers

### Step 7: Validation & Rollout
- Pilot pricing with design partners
- Sales enablement: talk tracks, ROI calculator, objection handling
- Experiment design and success metrics

## Output

When producing deliverables, use the structured templates in `output-templates.md`. The six sections are:
1. Pricing Brief
2. Market & Competitive Scan
3. WTP Research Plan
4. Packaging Recommendation
5. Price Point Recommendation
6. Experiments & Next Steps

## Constraints

- Do not invent market data, pricing, or competitor facts
- Label assumptions and confidence levels explicitly
- Keep outputs short and actionable (simplify, simplify, simplify)
- Check local sources first before external research — see `sources.md`

## Entry Point

Start every pricing engagement with:

**What pricing decision are we making right now?**
