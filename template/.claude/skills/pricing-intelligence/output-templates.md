# Output Templates

Use these templates when producing pricing deliverables. Not every engagement needs all six sections — use the ones relevant to the decision at hand.

---

## 1. Pricing Brief

The executive summary. Always produce this first.

```markdown
### Pricing Brief

**Decision**: [New price / packaging change / reprice — scope and timeline]
**Target Segment**: [ICP + buying center + deal size band]
**Value Metric**: [Primary metric + why it scales with customer value]
**Value Hypothesis**: [1-2 sentence ROI framing — what outcome does the customer get?]
**Contract Model**: [Monthly/annual, seat/usage/hybrid, commitment terms]
**Key Constraints**: [Sales motion, procurement, migration, legal]
```

---

## 2. Market & Competitive Scan

Context on how the market prices similar products.

```markdown
### Market & Competitive Scan

**Comparable Products**: [Top 3-5 with pricing model summary]

| Competitor | Model | Entry Price | Mid-Tier | Enterprise | Notes |
|------------|-------|-------------|----------|------------|-------|
| [Name] | [Seat/usage/hybrid] | [$X] | [$Y] | [Custom] | [Key differentiator or trap] |

**Dominant Models**: [Seat / usage / hybrid / outcome-based — what's standard?]
**Price Fences**: [Key gates and add-ons in the market]
**Risks & Traps**: [Commoditization, over-discounting, value metric mismatch, race to bottom]
```

## 3. WTP Research Plan

How to validate the pricing hypothesis with data.

```markdown
### WTP Research Plan

**Method**: [PSM / Gabor-Granger / Conjoint / Interviews — see wtp-research-methods.md]
**Why This Method**: [1 sentence on why it fits this decision]
**Sample**: [Who, how many, recruitment channel]
**Key Questions**:
1. [Question]
2. [Question]
3. [Question]

**Decision Rule**: [How the pricing band will be chosen from results — e.g., "Set list price at IDP from PSM, validate with 5 enterprise interviews"]
**Timeline**: [Weeks to completion]
```

## 4. Packaging Recommendation

Tier or module design with fence logic.

```markdown
### Packaging Recommendation

**Structure**: [Good/Better/Best or Modular Add-Ons]

| | [Tier 1 Name] | [Tier 2 Name] | [Tier 3 Name] |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Who it's for** | [Segment] | [Segment] | [Segment] |
| [Fence 1] | [Value] | [Value] | [Value] |
| [Fence 2] | [Value] | [Value] | [Value] |
| [Fence 3] | [Value] | [Value] | [Value] |
| **Price** | [$X] | [$Y] | [$Z / Custom] |

**Fence Logic**: [Why each tier boundary exists — what value milestone does it represent?]
**Upgrade Triggers**: [Usage or value milestones that signal tier progression]
**30-Second Test**: [Can a buyer self-select from a pricing page? Yes/No + what to simplify]
```

---

## 5. Price Point Recommendation

The specific number and policy around it.

```markdown
### Price Point Recommendation

**List Price Band**: [$X - $Y per [unit] per [period]]
**Anchor Price**: [$Z — the number on the pricing page]
**Rationale**: [How this was derived — WTP data, competitive benchmarks, value model]

**Discount Policy**:
- Floor: [Minimum acceptable price — never go below]
- Standard discount: [X% for annual commit / volume / strategic]
- Approval triggers: [Who approves discounts beyond X%]

**Migration Plan**:
- Existing customers: [Grandfathered / phased rollout / renewal-based transition]
- Timeline: [When migration starts and completes]
- Communication: [How customers will be notified]
```

## 6. Experiments & Next Steps

What to do after the recommendation.

```markdown
### Experiments & Next Steps

**Validation**:
1. [Pricing pilot — who, what, how long, success criteria]
2. [A/B test design if applicable]

**Enablement**:
3. [Sales talk track or one-pager to create]
4. [ROI calculator or value model to build]
5. [Objection handling guide for top 3 objections]

**Monitoring**:
6. [Metrics to track — conversion, ARPU, discount rate, churn, expansion]
7. [Review cadence — when to revisit pricing based on data]
```
