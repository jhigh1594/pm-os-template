# Stakeholder-Management Skill: Architecture & Design Plan

## Purpose
The stakeholder-management skill enables **sustained stakeholder relationship building and cross-functional leadership** for driving alignment and outcomes over weeks/months.

## Enhanced Scope: Beyond /align Command

**What /align command covers:**
- One-time stakeholder alignment sessions
- Stakeholder mapping for specific decisions
- Preparing for alignment meetings
- Single-event focus

**What this skill adds (ongoing, multi-month):**
- **Building long-term stakeholder relationships** (not just one-time alignment)
- **Cross-functional leadership** (leading without authority, team building)
- **Political navigation** (organizational dynamics, coalition building)
- **Influence campaigns** (sustained persuasion over time)
- **Conflict resolution** (navigating disagreements, tough conversations)
- **Team performance** (motivating teams, building high-performing product teams)

## Why This Matters

**From user's principles:**
- "Soft skills greatly outweigh hard skills" → Core PM competency
- "Best PMs run through walls" → Requires influence and coalition building
- "Continuous discovery, cross-functional collaboration" → Leadership is critical

**Reality of senior/principal PM work:**
- 20-30% of time: Stakeholder management, influence, alignment
- Critical for success: Can't ship great products without great relationships
- Force multiplier: Strong stakeholder relationships = faster decisions, more resources, better outcomes

## How It's Different from /align Command

| Aspect | /align Command | stakeholder-management Skill |
|--------|---------------|------------------------------|
| **Duration** | Single session (30-45 min) | Ongoing (weeks/months) |
| **Scope** | One-time alignment | Long-term relationships |
| **Focus** | Specific decision/event | Sustained influence |
| **Activities** | Map stakeholders, prep meeting | Build coalitions, resolve conflicts, lead teams |
| **Output** | Alignment plan | Organizational influence, team performance |
| **Use Case** | Aligning on product decision | Building political capital, cross-functional leadership |

## When to Use stakeholder-management Skill

**Use this skill when:**
- Building long-term stakeholder relationships (new role, new company)
- Navigating complex organizational politics
- Building coalitions for major initiatives
- Resolving ongoing cross-functional conflicts
- Developing high-performing product teams
- Leading without authority
- Influence campaigns over weeks/months

**Use /align command when:**
- Quick stakeholder alignment for specific decision
- Preparing for one alignment meeting
- Mapping stakeholders for a project

## Skill Architecture

### Phase 1: Stakeholder Landscape Mapping (Initial session, 45-60 min)
**Goal:** Understand organizational landscape and key relationships

**Activities:**
1. **Map the Organization**
   - Key decision makers (who approves budget, roadmap, priorities)
   - Influencers (who sways decision makers)
   - Cross-functional partners (engineering, design, marketing, sales, support)
   - Power structures (formal org chart vs. informal influence)

2. **Assess Current Relationships**
   - Who are your allies? (already supportive)
   - Who are neutrals? (could be swayed)
   - Who are skeptics? (have concerns)
   - Who are blockers? (actively opposed)

3. **Identify Influence Patterns**
   - How do decisions get made? (formal process vs. informal)
   - Who influences whom? (who listens to who)
   - What's the political capital currency? (data, customer evidence, executive support)

4. **Define Relationship Goals**
   - Who do you NEED to build strong relationships with?
   - What political capital do you need to build?
   - What perception gaps do you need to close?

**Output:** Stakeholder landscape map with relationship strategy

### Phase 2: Relationship Building (Ongoing, weeks/months)
**Goal:** Build trust, credibility, and influence systematically

**Activities:**

#### **Building Trust**

**With Leadership:**
- Deliver on commitments consistently
- Provide BLUF updates (bottom line up front)
- Escalate early (no surprises)
- Show strategic thinking (connect product to business outcomes)
- Ask for feedback and act on it

**With Engineering Partners:**
- Respect technical expertise
- Involve engineers early in discovery
- Protect engineering time (say no to non-essential work)
- Advocate for tech debt and quality
- Celebrate engineering wins

**With Design Partners:**
- Collaborate on problem framing (not just execution)
- Give design space to explore
- Involve design in strategy discussions
- Fight for design quality
- Champion user-centered thinking

**With Cross-functional Partners (Sales, Marketing, Support):**
- Understand their goals and constraints
- Provide visibility into roadmap
- Act on their feedback (close the loop)
- Make them successful (enablement, training)
- Share credit generously

#### **Earning Political Capital**

**How to build capital:**
- Ship high-impact work (results build credibility)
- Help others succeed (reciprocity matters)
- Deliver bad news honestly and early (builds trust)
- Take ownership of mistakes (accountability)
- Give credit away (lift others up)

**How to spend capital:**
- Push back on bad ideas (when it matters)
- Advocate for controversial decisions
- Ask for resources/budget
- Challenge the status quo

**Capital management:**
- Don't hoard capital (use it when it matters)
- Don't spend capital frivolously (pick battles)
- Replenish after spending (deliver wins after tough pushback)

#### **Influence Strategies**

**Data-driven influence:**
- Customer evidence (most powerful)
- Business impact data (revenue, retention, efficiency)
- Competitive intelligence
- Market research

**Narrative influence:**
- Storytelling (customer stories, vision narratives)
- Simplify complex ideas (make it easy to understand and repeat)
- Repetition (message consistency over time)

**Coalition influence:**
- Build alliances (find allies, build coalitions)
- Executive sponsorship (enlist leaders to advocate)
- Cross-functional support (engineering + design + sales alignment)

**Reciprocity influence:**
- Help others first (build goodwill)
- Find win-win solutions (mutual benefit)
- Make others look good (they'll support you)

**Output:** Growing political capital, strengthening relationships

---

### Phase 3: Conflict Resolution & Tough Conversations (As needed)
**Goal:** Navigate disagreements and resolve conflicts effectively

**Types of Conflicts:**

#### **Priority Conflicts**
- **Scenario:** Different stakeholders want different things prioritized
- **Resolution:**
  - Make prioritization criteria explicit
  - Use frameworks (RICE, Value/Effort) to create objectivity
  - Show trade-offs clearly (if we do X, we can't do Y until [date])
  - Escalate if needed (some conflicts require executive tie-breaker)

#### **Vision/Strategy Misalignment**
- **Scenario:** Fundamental disagreement on direction
- **Resolution:**
  - Seek first to understand (what's driving their view?)
  - Find common ground (shared goals, values)
  - Disagree and commit (clarity > consensus)
  - Escalate if unresolvable

#### **Resource Conflicts**
- **Scenario:** Competing for engineering/design capacity
- **Resolution:**
  - Quantify impact (which work drives more value?)
  - Negotiate scope (can both get something?)
  - Escalate resource constraint to leadership
  - Defer lower-priority work explicitly

#### **Cross-functional Tension**
- **Scenario:** PM vs. Engineering, PM vs. Sales, Design vs. Engineering
- **Resolution:**
  - Diagnose root cause (misaligned incentives? communication gaps?)
  - Find shared goals (what do we both want?)
  - Build empathy (walk in their shoes)
  - Create forum for collaboration

**Tough Conversation Frameworks:**

**Non-Violent Communication (NVC):**
1. **Observation:** "I noticed that [objective fact]"
2. **Feeling:** "I feel [emotion]"
3. **Need:** "Because I need [underlying need]"
4. **Request:** "Would you be willing to [specific, actionable request]?"

**Radical Candor (Care Personally + Challenge Directly):**
- Care about the person
- Be direct about the issue
- Avoid ruinous empathy (care but don't challenge = enabling)
- Avoid obnoxious aggression (challenge but don't care = asshole)

**Output:** Resolved conflicts, preserved relationships

---

### Phase 4: Cross-Functional Leadership (Ongoing)
**Goal:** Build high-performing product teams and lead without authority

**Activities:**

#### **Team Building**

**Creating Clarity:**
- Clear product vision (where we're going)
- Clear priorities (what matters most right now)
- Clear success criteria (how we'll know if we win)
- Clear roles (who owns what)

**Building Trust:**
- Consistency (do what you say you'll do)
- Transparency (share context, explain decisions)
- Vulnerability (admit mistakes, ask for help)
- Psychological safety (make it safe to disagree, experiment, fail)

**Motivation & Engagement:**
- Connect work to impact (why this matters)
- Autonomy (give space to solve problems)
- Mastery (help people grow and learn)
- Purpose (meaningful work that matters)

#### **Leading Without Authority**

**Principles:**
- **Influence, not control:** You can't command, you must convince
- **Servant leadership:** Make the team successful
- **Credibility through results:** Ship great work
- **Respect expertise:** Engineers know engineering, designers know design
- **Collaborate, don't dictate:** Best ideas come from collaboration

**Tactics:**
- Ask questions (Socratic method to guide thinking)
- Provide context (explain the "why")
- Propose, don't demand ("What if we..." vs. "You should...")
- Defer to expertise (let engineers make technical calls)
- Build consensus (align, don't force)

#### **Coaching & Development**

**For team members:**
- Regular 1:1s (career development, feedback)
- Skill development (help them grow)
- Stretch assignments (opportunities to learn)
- Recognition (public praise, private feedback)

**For yourself:**
- Reflect on leadership style
- Seek feedback (how am I doing as a leader?)
- Learn from mistakes
- Invest in relationships

**Output:** High-performing, motivated product teams
