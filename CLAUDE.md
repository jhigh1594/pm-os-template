# AI Agent Instructions for [YOUR COMPANY] Product Management Workspace

> **Note**: This file contains project-specific context. Customize the sections marked with [UPDATE THIS].

## Quick Start (For AI Assistants)

**First 3 Things**:
1. Check `GOALS.md` for role, portfolio, current goals, and key stakeholders
2. Check `📋 Tasks/today.md` for daily priorities and active work
3. Check `🤖 AI/memory/memory.md` for current focus

**Context**: See `GOALS.md` for role, portfolio, and current goals.

**Common Commands**: `/today`, `/think`, `/brainstorm`, `/compete` — see `.claude/commands/COMMAND-REFERENCE.md`

**Working principle**: Simplicity > Complexity. Shorter is almost always better. Plain language beats jargon. When in doubt, simplify.

**Before any strategic decision or spec**: Braindump before structure — get raw thinking out first, then organize.

## Product Rules

These rules define how to operate as a 10X Product Leader. Reference them proactively.

| Rule | When to Reference |
|------|-------------------|
| **pm-core.mdc** | DEFAULT - Always loaded — Core operating principles, quick references, conflict resolution |
| **pm-mental-models.mdc** | Strategic thinking, investment decisions — Load on trigger |
| **pm-decision-detail.mdc** | Decision documentation, reviews — Load on trigger |
| **pm-frameworks.mdc** | Framework selection, when to abandon — Load on trigger |
| **pm-communication.mdc** | Communication deep-dive, audience patterns — Load on trigger |
| **pm-product-sense.mdc** | Product sense/quality, taste vs data — Load on trigger |

**Default**: Follow `pm-core.mdc` always. Detail files load via MEMORY.md wake-on-trigger pattern.

## Memory Bank

Single unified context file: **`🤖 AI/memory/memory.md`**. Update when session focus or milestones change; use `/refresh-memory` to append session activity.

---

## Accumulated Wisdom

See **`🤖 AI/patterns/learned-patterns.md`** for workspace conventions, past decisions, and patterns worth preserving.

### Self-Improving Knowledge System

**Knowledge router**: `📚 Knowledge/INDEX.md` — read this first to decide which domain subfolder to load rather than listing all files.

**Hypothesis tracking**: Domain-level unvalidated beliefs live in:
- `📚 Knowledge/Growth/hypotheses.md`
- `📚 Knowledge/Market/hypotheses.md`

Add a hypothesis when you observe a pattern but don't have 3+ confirmations yet. Promote to `🤖 AI/patterns/learned-patterns.md` at 3 confirmations using the 4 quality gates: Actionable, Specific, Durable, Non-obvious.
