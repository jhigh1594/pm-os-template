## 2d. Signal vs Noise Classification

**Scoring Framework Applied:**
Signal Strength = Frequency (1-10+) × Severity (0.5-3) × Strategic Fit (0-3)

| Theme | Frequency | Severity | Strategic Fit | Score | Classification |
|-------|-----------|----------|---------------|-------|----------------|
| [Theme 1] | [N mentions] | [Critical/High/Med/Low] | [Core/Adjacent/Tangent/Off] | [Score] | [Very Strong / Strong / Medium / Weak] |
| [Theme 2] | [N mentions] | [Critical/High/Med/Low] | [Core/Adjacent/Tangent/Off] | [Score] | [Very Strong / Strong / Medium / Weak] |
| [Theme 3] | [N mentions] | [Critical/High/Med/Low] | [Core/Adjacent/Tangent/Off] | [Score] | [Very Strong / Strong / Medium / Weak] |

**Very Strong Signals** (60+ score):
- [Theme]: [Why this is very strong - frequency, severity, fit evidence]

**Strong Signals** (30-59 score):
- [Theme]: [Why this is strong]

**Medium Signals** (10-29 score):
- [Theme]: [Why tracking but not prioritizing yet]

**Weak Signals / Noise** (<10 score):
- [Theme]: [Why classified as noise]

**Surprises & Outliers:**
- [Unexpected finding 1]: [Why surprising, what it means]
