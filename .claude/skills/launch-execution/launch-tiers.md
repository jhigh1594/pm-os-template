## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| **Everything is Tier 1** | Resource dilution, team burnout | Be ruthlessly honest about impact |
| **Tier 3 gets no enablement** | Sales blindsided by customer questions | Minimum viable enablement for all |
| **Tier determined by effort, not impact** | Small features with huge impact underserved | Focus on customer/business impact |
| **Tier locked at planning** | Market changes during development | Re-evaluate tier at 50% and 80% complete |
