## Core Product Strategy Frameworks

### **Strategy Kernel** (Rumelt)
**Best for:** Diagnosing strategic challenges and defining coherent action plans

**Source:** `@pm-resources/Frameworks/strategy/rumelt-strategy-kernel.md`

**Structure:**
1. **Diagnosis** - What's really going on here? What's the core challenge?
2. **Guiding Policy** - Our overall approach to dealing with it
3. **Coherent Actions** - Feasible coordinated steps that follow from the policy

**Use when:**
- You need to diagnose a complex strategic situation
- Your "strategy" feels like a list of goals rather than actual strategy
- You need to make hard tradeoffs and focus resources
- You're developing product strategy from scratch

**Key questions to ask:**
- What's the actual challenge or opportunity we're facing?
- What's our overall approach? (Should make someone disagree)
- What specific actions reinforce each other?

**Red flags (bad strategy):**
- "Increase revenue" / "Delight customers" / "Be the market leader"
- These are goals, not strategy
- Good strategy makes hard choices and says NO to good options

### **DHM** (Gibson Biddle - Netflix)
**Best for:** Evaluating and strengthening product strategy across three critical dimensions

**Source:** `@pm-resources/Frameworks/strategy/gibson-biddle-dhm.md`

**Structure:**
1. **Delight** - Does this solve a meaningful customer problem?
2. **Hard to Copy** - What makes this defensible?
3. **Margin-Enhancing** - Does this improve our business model?

**Use when:**
- Evaluating strategic options or feature priorities
- Assessing competitive positioning
- Pressure-testing a new product or initiative
- Prioritizing investments

**Key questions to ask:**
- **Delight:** Is our solution 10x better? Do customers love it?
- **Hard to Copy:** What prevents competitors from copying this quickly? What gets stronger over time?
- **Margin-Enhancing:** Does this increase LTV or reduce CAC? What's the ROI?

**Scoring matrix:**
| Strategy | Delight | Hard to Copy | Margin-Enhancing | Assessment |
|----------|---------|--------------|------------------|------------|
| Strong | High | High | High | Ideal strategy |
| Weak | Low | Any | Any | Needs work |

**Remember:** Strong strategies score high on ALL THREE dimensions. Delight alone isn't enough.

### **Product Strategy Stack** (Reforge)
**Best for:** Understanding the hierarchy of mission → strategy → roadmap → goals

**Source:** `@pm-resources/Reforge/the-product-strategy-stack.md`

**Structure (top-down):**
1. **Company Mission** - The world your company sees and the change it wants to bring
2. **Company Strategy** - The logical plan to bring the mission into being
3. **Product Strategy** - How the product will drive its part of the company strategy
4. **Product Roadmap** - Sequence of features that implement the product strategy
5. **Product Goals** - Quarterly and day-to-day outcomes that measure progress

**Use when:**
- Goals feel untethered from strategy (common symptom)
- Team is unclear how their work connects to company objectives
- Prioritization is difficult because strategic context is missing
- You need to align product execution with company vision

**Key insight:** Product Strategy is the **connective tissue** between company objectives and product delivery work.

**Common trap:** Goals = Strategy (they're not—goals measure progress against strategy)

### **Working Backwards** (Amazon)
**Best for:** Customer-centric product definition starting from ideal end-state

**Source:** `@pm-resources/working-backwards-amazon.md`

**Structure:**
1. **Press Release** - Write the press release for launch day
2. **FAQ** - Anticipate customer questions
3. **Vision Document** - Spec out what you're building
4. **Then build** - Work backwards from the customer experience

**Use when:**
- Developing new products or major features
- You need clarity on customer experience before building
- You want to avoid building things customers don't want
- Aligning team on the desired end-state

**Key questions to ask:**
- What would the press release say on launch day?
- What customer problems are we solving?
- What would the FAQ look like?

**Benefits:**
- Forces customer-centric thinking
- Creates shared vision before diving into solution
- Reduces waste from building unwanted features

## Customer & Market Frameworks

### **Jobs-to-be-Done** (JTBD)
**Best for:** Understanding why customers hire products to make progress in their lives

**Sources:**
- `@lennys-podcast → customer-discovery.md` (6 episodes)
- Product-Management/customer-research/

**Structure:**
- **Jobs** - What progress is the customer trying to make?
- **Context** - When and where does this job arise?
- **Outcomes** - What does "done" look like?
- **Competition** - What are they currently using/solutions?
- **Anxieties** - What worries do they have about alternatives?

**Use when:**
- Exploring customer needs and pain points
- Designing products that fit naturally into customer lives
- Understanding why customers choose (or reject) your product
- Conducting customer interviews or discovery research

**Key questions to ask:**
- What job are you trying to get done?
- What triggers you to start thinking about this job?
- What does "success" look like for this job?
- What solutions have you tried? What worked/didn't?

**Remember:** Customers don't buy products—they hire products to do a job.

### **SWOT Analysis**
**Best for:** Rapid assessment of strategic position (classic but still useful)

**Source:** `@pm-resources/Frameworks/strategy/swot-analysis.md`

**Structure:**
1. **Strengths** - Internal advantages you have
2. **Weaknesses** - Internal gaps or constraints
3. **Opportunities** - External trends or changes you can leverage
4. **Threats** - External risks or competitive moves

**Use when:**
- Quick strategic assessment (30-60 min exercise)
- Evaluating competitive landscape
- Team offsite or strategy workshop
- Initial product strategy assessment

**Key questions to ask:**
- What advantages do we have that competitors don't?
- What gaps do we need to address?
- What market trends are we well-positioned to capitalize on?
- What competitive moves would hurt us most?

**Pro tip:** Pair with DHM framework—Strengths map to H (Hard to Copy), Opportunities map to D/M improvement areas.

## Analytical Frameworks

### **First Principles Thinking**
**Best for:** Breaking down complex problems to fundamental truths

**Source:** Referenced in `@pm-resources/Frameworks/strategy/product-strategy-coach.md`

**Structure:**
1. **Question assumptions** - What do we believe is true?
2. **Break down to fundamentals** - What are the basic truths?
3. **Build up from there** - What follows from these truths?
4. **Create novel solution** - What's possible now?

**Use when:**
- Tackling complex, ambiguous problems
- Existing approaches feel stale or incremental
- You need to innovate beyond "best practices"
- Challenging industry assumptions

**Key questions to ask:**
- What do we know is true?
- What would have to be true for this to work?
- What assumptions are we making that might not be true?

**Famous example:** Elon Musk breaking down rocket costs to first principles (raw materials cost vs. established pricing).

---

### **V2MOM**
**Best for:** Structuring goal-setting and OKRs with clear direction

**Source:** Referenced in `@pm-resources/Frameworks/strategy/product-strategy-coach.md`

**Structure:**
1. **Vision** - Where do we want to go?
2. **Values** - What's important to us? (Guiding principles)
3. **Methods** - How do we get there?
4. **Obstacles** - What challenges must we overcome?
5. **Metrics** - How do we measure success?

**Use when:**
- Defining quarterly or annual OKRs
- Clarifying strategic direction for the team
- Aligning leadership on priorities
- Translating strategy into measurable goals

**Key questions to ask:**
- What does success look like in 1-3 years?
- What principles will guide our decision-making?
- What are the key milestones to get there?
- What metrics indicate we're on track?

## Platform & Ecosystem Frameworks

### **Platform Thinking**
**Best for:** Designing products that enable others to create value

**Referenced in:** Multiple strategy framework files; Lenny's podcast transcripts

**Key concepts:**
- **Core Interaction** - The fundamental value exchange between platform participants
- **Network Effects** - Value increases with more users
- **Ecosystem Dynamics** - Third-party extensions and integrations
- **Side-of-Market** - Which participant segments are you connecting?

**Use when:**
- Building platform or marketplace products
- Designing plugin/integration architecture
- Evaluating platform vs. product strategy
- Understanding when to build vs. partner

**Key questions to ask:**
- What core asset can others leverage?
- How do we enable value creation by others?
- What's the platform vs. product split?
- What network effects can we create?

**Remember:** Platforms win when ecosystem effects create moats that pure products can't match.
