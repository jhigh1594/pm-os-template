# Stakeholder Communication Templates

This file provides comprehensive templates and guidance for communicating prioritization decisions to stakeholders while preserving relationships.

## Core Communication Principles

### The Four-Step Framework

1. **Acknowledge**: Thank them for the request + specific detail showing you heard them
2. **Explain**: Clear rationale (not strategy, not priority, not validated, not timing)
3. **Preserve**: "I've captured your feedback and we'll reconsider if [trigger]"
4. **Offer Alternative**: "In the meantime, have you considered [alternative approach]?"

### Key Principles

- **Never say no without explanation** - Empty rejection damages relationships
- **Preserve the relationship** by acknowledging the request
- **Show you heard them** by capturing specific feedback
- **Give them a reason to believe** their input matters
- **Set clear revisit triggers** so it's "not now, not never"

## NO Templates (Relationship-Preserving)

### Template 1: Not Aligned with Strategy

```
Subject: Update on your [Feature] request

Hi [Name],

Thank you for your suggestion about [feature/request]. I appreciate you taking the time to share this.

We're not able to prioritize this right now because it doesn't align with our current strategic focus on [current strategic theme]. We need to stay focused on [key priorities] to deliver the most value.

That said, I've captured your feedback and we'll reconsider if our strategy shifts or if we see strong demand from other customers.

Thanks again for your input - it helps us understand what matters to you.

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Template 2: Low Demand Relative to Priorities

```
Subject: Update on your [Feature] request

Hi [Name],

Thank you for your request about [feature/request].

We're not able to prioritize this right now because we've seen limited demand for this capability relative to other priorities. We need to focus on features that will benefit the widest customer base.

I've captured your feedback and we'll revisit this if we hear more requests from customers or if it becomes higher priority through our planning process.

Appreciate you sharing your perspective - it does inform our thinking.

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Template 3: Validated But Not Now (Timing Issue)

```
Subject: Update on your [Feature] request

Hi [Name],

Thank you for your feedback about [feature/request]. I understand this is important to you.

We agree this is valuable, but we're not able to prioritize it right now due to [capacity constraints/committed work/current roadmap]. We have to make tough choices about what to take on each quarter.

I've captured this and we'll reconsider when we plan our [next quarter/next half]. I'll reach out if timing opens up sooner.

Thanks for your patience and understanding.

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Template 4: Not Validated (Need More Data)

```
Subject: Update on your [Feature] request

Hi [Name],

Thank you for your suggestion about [feature/request].

We're not able to prioritize this right now because we don't have enough evidence yet that this is a widespread customer need. We need to validate the problem more broadly before committing to development.

If you're open to it, I'd love to learn more about your use case and how this impacts your work. This could help us build the case for prioritization.

Appreciate you sharing this idea - it's on our radar.

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Template 5: Alternative Solution Exists

```
Subject: Update on your [Feature] request

Hi [Name],

Thank you for your request about [feature/request].

We're not able to prioritize this right now because [existing feature/workaround] can currently address this need. We need to prioritize gaps where no solution exists.

In the meantime, have you tried [alternative approach]? Many customers find this works well for [use case].

That said, I've captured your feedback. If the alternative doesn't meet your needs or if we hear more requests, we'll revisit.

Thanks again for your input.

Best,
[Your name]
```

## Special Situations

### Executive Request (HiPPO Management)

```
Subject: Update on [Executive's Name] request

Hi [Executive Name],

I understand this is important to you. Let me make sure I properly capture the business case so I can weigh this appropriately against other opportunities.

Can you help me understand:
- What problem does this solve for your team?
- How urgent is this?
- What's the business impact if we don't do this now?

With this context, I can properly assess this against our other priorities and ensure we're making the right strategic call.

Thanks,
[Your name]
```

**Follow-up after prioritization:**

```
Subject: Update on [Feature]

Hi [Executive Name],

Thank you for the additional context on [feature/request].

After weighing this against our other priorities, I've [made this decision/force-ranked this at position X]. Here's my rationale:

Hi [Sales Rep Name],

I understand you need this for the [prospect/customer]. However, this request doesn't align with our current roadmap priorities because [rationale].

Let's explore alternatives:
1. Can we position [existing feature] as a solution?
2. Is there a workaround that addresses their core need?

Let's discuss - I'm open to your thoughts.

In the meantime, have you considered [alternative approach]? Many customers find this helps with [underlying problem].

## Opportunity Cost Communication

### Internal Communication (Leadership)

```
Subject: QX Roadmap - What We're Saying NO To

Team,

As we finalize our QX roadmap, I want to be transparent about the trade-offs we're making.

**What we're saying YES to:**
1. [Priority 1] - [Rationale]
2. [Priority 2] - [Rationale]
3. [Priority 3] - [Rationale]

**What we're saying NO to (and why):**
1. [Deferred Item] - [Rationale]
2. [Deferred Item] - [Rationale]
3. [Deferred Item] - [Rationale]

**This is the right trade-off because:** [Strategic rationale focusing on business impact and customer value]

Our capacity constraint is [X]. Everything we say YES to means saying NO to something else. These choices reflect our best judgment on what delivers the most value for [our customers/the business].

Happy to discuss individual trade-offs if you have questions.

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Opportunity Cost Documentation

**Template for documenting trade-offs:**

```
## Opportunity Cost Analysis

**By saying YES to [Item A], we're saying NO to:**

1. **[Item B]** - [Trade-off explanation]
   - Impact: [Who's affected, how much]
   - Revisit trigger: [What would change this priority]

2. **[Item C]** - [Trade-off explanation]
   - Impact: [Who's affected, how much]
   - Revisit trigger: [What would change this priority]

3. **[Item D]** - [Trade-off explanation]
   - Impact: [Who's affected, how much]
   - Revisit trigger: [What would change this priority]

**This is the right trade-off because:**
- [Strategic rationale 1]
- [Strategic rationale 2]
- [Strategic rationale 3]

**Confidence Level:** [High/Medium/Low]
**Re-evaluation trigger:** [What would cause us to revisit this decision]
```

## Revisit Triggers (Making "Not Now" Credible)

### Common Revisit Triggers

- **Demand-based**: "If we see 10+ customer requests for this, we'll reconsider"
- **Strategy-based**: "If our strategy shifts to focus on [new theme], this becomes more relevant"
- **Data-based**: "If we get data showing [specific impact], we'll reprioritize"
- **Competitive-based**: "If competitors gain traction with this, we'll reassess"
- **Capacity-based**: "If we complete early or free up resources, we'll revisit"
- **Customer-based**: "If a key customer makes this a dealbreaker, we'll evaluate"

### How to Set Credible Triggers

**Good triggers are:**
- Specific and measurable (not "if there's interest")
- Realistic (not "if 1000 customers request this")
- Within your control (not "if executives change their minds")
- Time-bound (not "someday maybe")

**Example:**
- ❌ Bad: "We'll reconsider if there's interest"
- ✅ Good: "We'll reconsider if 5+ customers request this in the next quarter"

## Communication Best Practices

### Timing

- **Communicate decisions promptly** - Don't let requests sit in limbo
- **Batch communication** - Group similar decisions for efficiency
- **Quarterly roadmap reviews** - Proactive communication beats reactive questions

### Tone

- **Appreciative** - Always thank them for the input
- **Clear but gentle** - Firm on the decision, kind in the delivery
- **Transparent** - Explain the why, not just the what
- **Humble** - Acknowledge you might be wrong, open to revisiting

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **No response** - Ghosting requests damages trust more than saying no
2. **Vague rejection** - "Not on the roadmap" without explanation frustrates people
3. **False hope** - "We'll consider it" when you mean "never"
4. **Defensive** - Taking feedback personally instead of treating it as data
5. **One-way communication** - Not offering alternatives or next steps

## Quick Reference: Rejection Rationale Categories

| Category | When to Use | Key Message |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Not Strategic** | Off-strategy request | "Doesn't align with current focus on [X]" |
| **Low Demand** | Few requests | "Limited demand relative to other priorities" |
| **Not Validated** | Needs more data | "Need more evidence of customer need" |
| **Capacity** | Resource constrained | "Can't take this on given committed work" |
| **Alternative Exists** | Workaround available | "[Existing feature] addresses this need" |
| **Timing** | Right idea, wrong time | "Valuable but not now due to [constraint]" |

---

Remember: How you communicate NO matters as much as the decision itself. Preserve relationships, show respect for their input, and keep the door open for future collaboration.
