# Common Challenges & Probing Questions

This file provides detailed handling of common prioritization challenges with probing questions to surface strategic trade-offs.

---

## Challenge 1: Too Many #1 Priorities

**Problem**: Everything is "high priority," nothing gets done well

**Root Cause**: Lack of force ranking, unclear strategic priorities, political pressure

**Solution**: Force rank everything. Use CEO/exec to break ties if needed.

**Probing Questions**:
- "Everything can't be priority #1—can you help me understand the relative urgency?"
- "If you had to choose ONLY 2 items from this top 10, which would deliver the most value?"
- "What's the opportunity cost of doing all of these—and doing none of them well?"
- "Which of these items, if delayed, would cause the most harm?"

**Ask the Stakeholder**:
- "I understand these are all important, but we have capacity for 3 this quarter. Which 3 give us the best strategic balance?"
- "Help me understand: if Item A and Item B are both #1, what makes you say they're equal priority?"

## Challenge 2: HiPPO (Highest Paid Person's Opinion)

**Problem**: Decisions driven by politics, not data

**Root Cause**: Executive or senior leader expresses strong preference for their pet project

**Solution**: Use frameworks to create objectivity. Show data. Acknowledge but validate.

**Probing Questions**:
- "This request came from the VP—should we weight it differently than customer feedback?"
- "What's the underlying business case for this executive request? How does it compare to other opportunities?"
- "If we prioritize this, what are we NOT prioritizing? What's the opportunity cost?"
- "Does this executive request align with our stated strategy and North Star?"

**Ask the Executive**:
- "I understand this is important to you. Can you help me understand the business impact so I can properly weigh it against other opportunities?"
- "What problem does this solve for you/your team? How urgent is it?"

## Challenge 3: Shiny Object Syndrome

**Problem**: Constantly changing priorities based on latest idea

**Root Cause**: Lack of discipline, quarterly roadmap violations, reactive decision-making

**Solution**: Revisit priorities quarterly, not weekly. Finish what you start.

**Probing Questions**:
- "This new item just came in—does it replace something above the line, or do we need to reassess the whole roadmap?"
- "We committed to our Q1 roadmap two weeks ago. What's changed that justifies this pivot?"
- "If we add this now, what do we deprioritize? What's the strategic impact of breaking our commitment?"

**Push Back Gently**:
- "Let's capture this for Q2 planning. We're executing Q1 and need to see it through to properly assess what's working."
- "I'm hearing enthusiasm for this new idea. Let's discuss it at our quarterly roadmap review where we can properly assess all opportunities."

## Challenge 4: Analysis Paralysis

**Problem**: Overthinking prioritization instead of shipping

**Root Cause**: Perfectionism, fear of making wrong decision, lack of clear decision criteria

**Solution**: Use simple framework (ICE or Value/Effort). Make decision, move forward.

**Probing Questions**:
- "We've spent 20 minutes discussing—should we just apply ICE and move forward?"
- "What's the cost of delaying this decision by another 30 minutes?"
- "We're 80% confident on the data we have—can we make a decision and iterate as we learn?"

**Move Forward**:
- "Let's apply ICE scoring now. We can always re-prioritize next quarter if we learn new information."
- "I recommend we proceed with [framework] and ship. Perfection is the enemy of good."

## Challenge 5: Ignoring Customer Requests

**Problem**: Building what you want, not what customers need

**Root Cause**: Internal bias, "we know better," lack of customer voice in prioritization

**Solution**: Use Three Buckets to ensure 30-40% of roadmap is customer requests.

**Probing Questions**:
- "Only 20% of above-the-line items are customer requests—is that the right balance?"
- "These 10 customer requests are all rated Signal Strong, but none made the cut—should we reconsider?"
- "When was the last time we shipped something our customers explicitly asked for?"
- "Are we building our product or our customers' product?"

**Use Three Buckets Guardrails**:
- Metrics Movers (30-50%): Internal strategic bets
- Customer Requests (30-40%): Voice of customer
- Delight/Innovation (20-30%): Market differentiation

## Challenge 6: Burning Bridges When Saying No

**Problem**: Saying no without explanation damages relationships

**Root Cause**: Lack of communication templates, fear of conflict, rushed rejections

**Solution**: Use communication templates. Explain why, not just no. Offer revisit triggers.

**Probing Questions**:
- "How do we tell Customer X we're not building their request without damaging the relationship?"
- "Sales promised Item E to a prospect—how do we manage that expectation?"
- "This stakeholder has influence—how do we say no while preserving the relationship?"

**Communication Framework**:
1. **Acknowledge**: "Thank you for the request" + specific detail
2. **Explain**: Clear rationale (not strategy, not priority, not validated, not timing)
3. **Preserve**: "I've captured your feedback and we'll reconsider if [trigger]"
4. **Offer alternative**: "In the meantime, have you considered [alternative approach]?"

**Key Principles**:
- Never say no without explanation
- Preserve the relationship by acknowledging the request
- Show you heard them by capturing the feedback
- Give them a reason to believe their input matters
- Set clear revisit triggers so it's not "never, just not now"

## Additional Challenge Patterns

### Challenge: Capacity Reality Mismatch

**Problem**: Roadmap includes more work than team can deliver

**Probing Questions**:
- "We have capacity for 8 story points this sprint, but we've committed to 12—what gives?"
- "These 5 items are all above the line—do we really have capacity for all three this quarter?"
- "What's the opportunity cost of overcommitting? What breaks if we're wrong?"

### Challenge: Conflicting Stakeholder Requests

**Problem**: Sales wants X, Support wants Y (opposite directions)

**Probing Questions**:
- "Customer A wants feature X, but Customer B (same segment) wants opposite Y—how should we navigate this conflict?"
- "Sales promised this to a prospect, but the feature request is off-strategy—how do we resolve this?"
- "This stakeholder has influence but their request doesn't align with strategy—how do we manage this?"

**Resolution Approach**:
1. **Acknowledge both perspectives**
2. **Apply strategic filters objectively**
3. **Document trade-offs**
4. **Communicate decisions with clear rationale**
5. **Preserve relationships with rejected stakeholders**

### Challenge: "We Need Everything"

**Problem**: Team claims all items are essential, can't prioritize

**Probing Questions**:
- "If you could only do 3 of these 10 items this quarter, which would deliver the most value?"
- "What's the minimum viable roadmap that still moves us forward?"
- "Which items can be deferred to next quarter without major impact?"

**Force Ranking Technique**:
- "Rank these 1-10. Now, we can only do top 3. Which are they?"
- "Draw a line: what's above and below the line? Be ruthless—everything can't be above the line."

## Summary: Challenge Resolution Matrix

| Challenge | Root Cause | Solution | Key Question |
|-----------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| Too Many #1 Priorities | No force ranking | Force rank, exec breaks ties | "If you could only do 2...?" |
| HiPPO | Politics over data | Framework objectivity | "What's the business case?" |
| Shiny Object Syndrome | Quarterly violations | Hold to roadmap, Q2 planning | "What changed since Q1?" |
| Analysis Paralysis | Perfectionism | Use simple framework, ship | "What's the cost of delaying?" |
| Ignoring Customers | Internal bias | Three Buckets guardrails | "What % is customer requests?" |
| Burning Bridges | Poor communication | Templates + rationale | "How to say no while preserving relationship?" |

## Universal Probing Questions

When stuck, ask these questions to unlock progress:

1. **Capacity**: "What can we realistically accomplish this quarter?"
2. **Trade-offs**: "If we say YES to X, what are we saying NO to?"
3. **Strategy**: "Does this move us toward our North Star?"
4. **Evidence**: "What data supports this priority?"
5. **Consistency**: "How does this align with last quarter's decisions?"
6. **Value**: "What problem does this solve, for whom, and how big is the impact?"
7. **Validation**: "What assumptions are we making? Have we tested them?"
8. **Timing**: "Why now? What changes if we defer to next quarter?"

## Response Templates for Tricky Situations

### When Executive Pushes Back

"I understand this is important to you. Let me make sure I properly capture the business case so I can weigh this appropriately against other opportunities. Can you help me understand [specific impact, urgency, business problem]?"

### When Team Overcommits

"I hear that we want to do everything. However, we have capacity for [X]. If we try to do [N] items, we'll likely deliver none of them well. Which [X] items give us the best strategic portfolio?"

### When Sales Makes Promises

"I understand you need this for the prospect. However, this request doesn't align with our current roadmap priorities. Can we explore [alternative approach, workaround, or different timeline]?"

### When Customer Requests Seem Off-Strategy

"Thank you for this feedback. I'm hearing this is important to you. Help me understand: what problem does this solve for you, and how does it fit with [our product's focus on X]?"

### When Stakeholder Has Influence But Wrong Idea

"I appreciate your perspective on this. I want to make sure I properly consider your input. Can we walk through the underlying problem you're solving and how this compares to other opportunities?"
