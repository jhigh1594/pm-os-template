# Stakeholder-Management Skill

## What This Skill Enables

The **stakeholder-management skill** enables you to build sustained stakeholder relationships and exercise cross-functional leadership over weeks and months. This skill goes beyond one-time alignment sessions to help you:

- **Build long-term stakeholder relationships** (not just align on specific decisions)
- **Lead without authority** (influence engineering, design, and cross-functional teams)
- **Navigate organizational politics** (build coalitions, earn political capital)
- **Resolve conflicts effectively** (manage disagreements without damaging relationships)
- **Build high-performing product teams** (motivate teams, create psychological safety)
- **Conduct sustained influence campaigns** (change minds over time)

## When to Use This Skill

**Use stakeholder-management skill when:**
- Starting a new role or company (building relationships from scratch)
- Navigating complex organizational politics
- Building coalitions for major initiatives requiring broad support
- Resolving ongoing cross-functional conflicts
- Developing high-performing product teams
- Leading without formal authority
- Running multi-week/month influence campaigns

**Use /align command when:**
- Quick stakeholder alignment for a specific decision
- Preparing for a single alignment meeting
- Mapping stakeholders for a project
- One-time alignment need

**Key Difference:**
- `/align` = Single session (30-45 min) for specific alignment
- `stakeholder-management` = Ongoing relationship work over weeks/months

## The Stakeholder-Management Process (4 Phases)

### Phase 1: Stakeholder Landscape Mapping (Initial session, 45-60 min)

**Goal:** Understand the organizational landscape and map key relationships.

When you invoke this skill, I'll guide you through:

#### 1. Map the Organization

**Key Decision Makers:**
- Who approves budget, roadmap, and priorities?
- Who has veto power over your initiatives?
- Who controls resources you need?

**Influencers:**
- Who sways the decision makers?
- Who has informal power or political capital?
- Who are the "go-to" people others listen to?

**Cross-Functional Partners:**
- Engineering leads and ICs you work with
- Design partners
- Marketing, Sales, Support, Data teams
- Other PMs or product leaders

**Power Structures:**
- What's the formal org chart?
- What's the informal influence network? (often different!)
- How do decisions actually get made?

#### 2. Assess Current Relationships

For each key stakeholder, we'll assess:

- **Allies:** Already supportive of you/your work
- **Neutrals:** Could be swayed either way
- **Skeptics:** Have concerns or reservations
- **Blockers:** Actively opposed or resistant

#### 3. Identify Influence Patterns

- How do decisions get made? (Formal process vs. informal hallway conversations)
- Who influences whom? (Who listens to who?)
- What's the political capital currency? (Data? Customer evidence? Executive support? Relationships?)
- What are the hidden power dynamics?

#### 4. Define Relationship Goals

- Who do you NEED to build strong relationships with?
- What political capital do you need to build?
- What perception gaps do you need to close?
- What coalitions do you need to form?

**Phase 1 Output:** Stakeholder landscape map with relationship strategy (see Reference Materials below)

---

### Phase 2: Relationship Building (Ongoing, weeks/months)

**Goal:** Build trust, credibility, and influence systematically.

This is ongoing work. Return to this skill regularly to:

#### Building Trust with Leadership

**Tactics:**
- **Deliver on commitments consistently** (say what you'll do, do what you say)
- **Provide BLUF updates** (Bottom Line Up Front - exec summary first)
- **Escalate early** (no surprises - bad news should never be a surprise)
- **Show strategic thinking** (connect product decisions to business outcomes)
- **Ask for feedback and act on it** (show you're learning and adapting)

**Questions to discuss:**
- What commitments have I made to leadership?
- How can I provide better strategic context in my updates?
- What decisions should I escalate vs. make myself?

#### Building Trust with Engineering Partners

**Tactics:**
- **Respect technical expertise** (let engineers own "how", you own "why")
- **Involve engineers early in discovery** (not just in execution)
- **Protect engineering time** (say no to non-essential work, fight scope creep)
- **Advocate for tech debt and quality** (give engineers space to do it right)
- **Celebrate engineering wins** (publicly recognize great work)

**Questions to discuss:**
- Am I involving engineering early enough in discovery?
- Am I respecting their technical expertise or dictating solutions?
- What tech debt should I advocate for?

#### Building Trust with Design Partners

**Tactics:**
- **Collaborate on problem framing** (not just execution)
- **Give design space to explore** (don't jump to solutions too quickly)
- **Involve design in strategy discussions** (not just "make it pretty")
- **Fight for design quality** (push back on "just ship it" pressure)
- **Champion user-centered thinking** (design brings user empathy)

**Questions to discuss:**
- How can I involve design earlier in strategic decisions?
- Where should I give design more space to explore?

#### Building Trust with Cross-Functional Partners (Sales, Marketing, Support)

**Tactics:**
- **Understand their goals and constraints** (what does success look like for them?)
- **Provide visibility into roadmap** (no surprises)
- **Act on their feedback** (close the loop - show you heard them)
- **Make them successful** (provide enablement, training, tools)
- **Share credit generously** (lift them up publicly)

**Questions to discuss:**
- What are their goals and how can I help them succeed?
- Am I closing the loop on their feedback?

#### Earning Political Capital

**How to Build Capital:**
- **Ship high-impact work** (results build credibility)
- **Help others succeed** (reciprocity matters - they'll help you back)
- **Deliver bad news honestly and early** (builds trust)
- **Take ownership of mistakes** (accountability builds respect)
- **Give credit away** (lift others up, they'll remember)

**How to Spend Capital:**
- **Push back on bad ideas** (when it really matters)
- **Advocate for controversial decisions**
- **Ask for resources/budget**
- **Challenge the status quo**

**Capital Management:**
- Don't hoard capital (use it when it matters)
- Don't spend frivolously (pick your battles)
- Replenish after spending (deliver wins after tough pushback)

#### Influence Strategies

**Data-Driven Influence:**
- Customer evidence (most powerful)
- Business impact data (revenue, retention, efficiency)
- Competitive intelligence
- Market research

**Narrative Influence:**
- Storytelling (customer stories, vision narratives)
- Simplify complex ideas (make it easy to understand and repeat)
- Repetition (consistent messaging over time)

**Coalition Influence:**
- Build alliances (find allies, build coalitions)
- Executive sponsorship (enlist leaders to advocate)
- Cross-functional support (engineering + design + sales alignment)

**Reciprocity Influence:**
- Help others first (build goodwill)
- Find win-win solutions (mutual benefit)
- Make others look good (they'll support you)

**Phase 2 Output:** Growing political capital, strengthening relationships, increased organizational influence

---

### Phase 3: Conflict Resolution & Tough Conversations (As needed)

**Goal:** Navigate disagreements and resolve conflicts without damaging relationships.

Return to this skill when you encounter conflicts. I'll help you prepare and navigate:

#### Types of Conflicts

**Priority Conflicts:**
- **Scenario:** Different stakeholders want different things prioritized
- **Resolution Approach:**
  - Make prioritization criteria explicit
  - Use frameworks (RICE, Value/Effort) to create objectivity
  - Show trade-offs clearly (if we do X, we can't do Y until [date])
  - Escalate if needed (some conflicts require executive tie-breaker)

**Vision/Strategy Misalignment:**
- **Scenario:** Fundamental disagreement on direction
- **Resolution Approach:**
  - Seek first to understand (what's driving their view?)
  - Find common ground (shared goals, values)
  - Disagree and commit (clarity > consensus)
  - Escalate if unresolvable

**Resource Conflicts:**
- **Scenario:** Competing for engineering/design capacity
- **Resolution Approach:**
  - Quantify impact (which work drives more value?)
  - Negotiate scope (can both get something?)
  - Escalate resource constraint to leadership
  - Defer lower-priority work explicitly

**Cross-Functional Tension:**
- **Scenario:** PM vs. Engineering, PM vs. Sales, Design vs. Engineering
- **Resolution Approach:**
  - Diagnose root cause (misaligned incentives? communication gaps?)
  - Find shared goals (what do we both want?)
  - Build empathy (walk in their shoes)
  - Create forum for collaboration

#### Tough Conversation Frameworks

**Non-Violent Communication (NVC):**
1. **Observation:** "I noticed that [objective fact]"
2. **Feeling:** "I feel [emotion]"
3. **Need:** "Because I need [underlying need]"
4. **Request:** "Would you be willing to [specific, actionable request]?"

**Radical Candor (Care Personally + Challenge Directly):**
- Care about the person
- Be direct about the issue
- Avoid ruinous empathy (care but don't challenge = enabling)
- Avoid obnoxious aggression (challenge but don't care = asshole)

**When you have a tough conversation coming up, invoke this skill and I'll help you:**
- Prepare using the Tough Conversation Prep Template (see Reference Materials)
- Anticipate their perspective
- Plan your approach
- Develop backup plans if things get defensive or emotional

**Phase 3 Output:** Resolved conflicts, preserved relationships, documented learnings

---

### Phase 4: Cross-Functional Leadership (Ongoing)

**Goal:** Build high-performing product teams and lead without authority.

Return to this skill regularly to strengthen team leadership:

#### Creating Clarity

High-performing teams have clarity on:
- **Clear product vision** (where we're going)
- **Clear priorities** (what matters most right now)
- **Clear success criteria** (how we'll know if we win)
- **Clear roles** (who owns what)

**Questions to discuss:**
- Does the team have clarity on vision and priorities?
- Are success criteria well-defined?
- Are roles and ownership clear?

#### Building Trust

Trust is built through:
- **Consistency** (do what you say you'll do)
- **Transparency** (share context, explain decisions)
- **Vulnerability** (admit mistakes, ask for help)
- **Psychological safety** (make it safe to disagree, experiment, fail)

**Questions to discuss:**
- Am I creating psychological safety?
- Where am I being inconsistent?
- Where should I be more transparent?

#### Motivation & Engagement

Teams are motivated by:
- **Connect work to impact** (why this matters)
- **Autonomy** (give space to solve problems their way)
- **Mastery** (help people grow and learn)
- **Purpose** (meaningful work that matters)

**Questions to discuss:**
- Is the team energized or burned out?
- How can I better connect our work to impact?
- Where should I give more autonomy?

#### Leading Without Authority

**Core Principles:**
- **Influence, not control:** You can't command, you must convince
- **Servant leadership:** Make the team successful (your job is to unblock and enable)
- **Credibility through results:** Ship great work
- **Respect expertise:** Engineers know engineering, designers know design
- **Collaborate, don't dictate:** Best ideas come from collaboration

**Tactics:**
- Ask questions (Socratic method to guide thinking)
- Provide context (explain the "why")
- Propose, don't demand ("What if we..." vs. "You should...")
- Defer to expertise (let engineers make technical calls)
- Build consensus (align, don't force)

**Questions to discuss:**
- Where am I dictating vs. collaborating?
- Where should I defer more to expertise?
- How can I build more consensus?

#### Coaching & Development

**For team members:**
- Regular 1:1s (career development, feedback)
- Skill development (help them grow)
- Stretch assignments (opportunities to learn)
- Recognition (public praise, private feedback)

**For yourself:**
- Reflect on leadership style
- Seek feedback (how am I doing as a leader?)
- Learn from mistakes
- Invest in relationships

**Phase 4 Output:** High-performing, motivated product teams with strong cross-functional collaboration

### 3. Cross-Functional Leadership Playbook

Use this playbook to diagnose and improve team performance:

```markdown
## Building High-Performing Product Teams

### Team Health Assessment

**Clarity (Do we have shared understanding?):**
- [ ] Clear product vision (where we're going)
- [ ] Clear priorities (what matters most right now)
- [ ] Clear success criteria (how we'll know if we win)
- [ ] Clear roles and responsibilities (who owns what)

**Trust (Do we trust each other?):**
- [ ] Psychological safety (safe to disagree, experiment, fail)
- [ ] Consistency (we do what we say)
- [ ] Transparency (we share context, explain decisions)
- [ ] Respect for expertise (we defer to each other's strengths)

**Motivation (Are we energized?):**
- [ ] Connected to impact (we understand why this matters)
- [ ] Autonomy (we have space to solve problems our way)
- [ ] Growth opportunities (we're learning and developing)
- [ ] Meaningful work (this matters to us personally)

**Collaboration (Do we work well together?):**
- [ ] Healthy PM-Eng partnership
- [ ] Strong PM-Design collaboration
- [ ] Cross-functional alignment (sales, marketing, support)
- [ ] Effective communication

### Leadership Actions by Scenario

**Scenario 1: Team is unclear on priorities**

**Diagnosis:**
- Are priorities changing frequently?
- Are there too many "top priorities"?
- Is there disagreement on what's most important?

**Action:**
- Hold prioritization session using RICE or Value/Effort framework
- Document top 3 priorities
- Explicitly say no to everything else
- Communicate "why" behind priorities
- Revisit priorities regularly but not too frequently

**Scenario 2: Team morale is low**

**Diagnose root cause:**
- [ ] Are we losing? (lack of progress, stuck on hard problems)
- [ ] Are we burned out? (unsustainable pace, too much WIP)
- [ ] Are we unclear? (lack of clarity on direction)
- [ ] Are we unappreciated? (lack of recognition)

**Action based on diagnosis:**
- **Losing:** Celebrate small wins, ship something (momentum matters)
- **Burned out:** Reduce scope, extend timeline, add capacity, remove blockers
- **Unclear:** Provide clarity on vision, priorities, and success criteria
- **Unappreciated:** Recognize contributions publicly, celebrate wins

**Scenario 3: PM-Eng tension**

**Common Causes:**
- PM dictating technical solutions ("just build it this way")
- Eng pushing back on all product ideas
- Lack of context sharing (eng doesn't understand "why")
- Misaligned incentives (PM rewarded for features, Eng for quality)

**Action:**
- Respect technical expertise (let eng own "how", you own "why")
- Involve eng early in discovery (not just execution)
- Share context abundantly (explain the "why" behind decisions)
- Align on outcomes, not outputs (what we're trying to achieve, not how)
- Find win-win solutions (advocate for eng needs like tech debt)

**Scenario 4: Cross-functional misalignment**

**Diagnosis:**
- What's the source of misalignment? (Different goals? Different information? Different incentives?)
- Is this a one-time disagreement or systemic issue?

**Action:**
- Hold alignment session (PM + Eng + Design + other functions)
- Clarify shared goals (what do we all want?)
- Identify points of disagreement (where do we differ and why?)
- Find common ground (where can we agree?)
- Disagree and commit if needed (clarity > consensus)
- Address systemic issues if this is recurring

**Scenario 5: Team velocity is declining**

**Diagnose root cause:**
- [ ] Are we taking on too much?
- [ ] Is quality suffering? (Tech debt accumulating)
- [ ] Are there persistent blockers?
- [ ] Is team capacity changing? (Attrition, PTO, other work)
- [ ] Are estimates getting more accurate? (Velocity might be stable, we're just better at estimating)

**Action:**
- Review sprint commitments (are we overcommitting?)
- Allocate time for tech debt (20% is common)
- Use unblocking playbook (from execution-delivery skill)
- Adjust capacity planning
- Focus on sustainable pace, not maximum velocity
```
