## Communication Quality Bar

All PM communication must meet these standards:

### **1. Purpose-Driven**
- Every document, email, or presentation answers: "What outcome am I driving?"
- Acceptable outcomes: Decision made, alignment created, action taken, understanding achieved
- Unacceptable: "Sharing information" without clear purpose

### **2. Audience-Optimized**
- Match format and depth to audience
- Default: If unsure, optimize for the most senior person in the audience

### **3. Evidence-Based**
- No claims without sources (data, research, customer quotes)
- Label clearly: "DATA: ..." "CUSTOMER QUOTE: ..." "HYPOTHESIS: ..." "ASSUMPTION: ..."

### **4. Clarity-First**
- Simple words over sophisticated language
- Short sentences over complex constructions
- Active voice over passive voice
- 12-year-old test: Can a smart middle-schooler understand the core idea?

### **5. Scannable Structure**
- Lead with the most important point (no warm-up, no preamble)
- Use headings, bullets, bold, and white space liberally
- Visual > text when possible
- TL;DR at the top for anything > 1 page

### **6. Actionable**
- Every communication ends with clear next steps
- Specify: Who does what by when
- One primary CTA, avoid choice paralysis

## Executive Communication

**Goal:** Enable fast, confident decisions with minimal cognitive load

### **Structure Template:**
```
DECISION NEEDED: [Specific ask] by [date]

RECOMMENDATION: [What you recommend] because [top 2 reasons]

CONTEXT: [2-3 sentences of essential background]

OPTIONS CONSIDERED:
1. [Option A]: [Outcome] - [Key tradeoff]
2. [Option B]: [Outcome] - [Key tradeoff]

RATIONALE: [Why your recommendation, with evidence]

RISKS & MITIGATIONS: [What could go wrong, how you'll handle it]

NEXT STEPS: [What happens if approved]
```

### **Frameworks:**
- **BLUF:** Decision/recommendation first, rationale after
- **Pyramid Principle:** Conclusion first, supporting arguments grouped logically
- **SCQA:** Set context, identify problem, pose question, provide answer

### **Principles:**
- Lead with recommendation, not analysis
- 1-pager max for summary, appendix for details
- Quantify everything (time, money, risk, impact)
- Frame in business outcomes, not features
- Respect their time—optimize for 2-minute read

### **Anti-patterns:**
- ❌ Burying the ask on page 3
- ❌ Presenting 5 equally weighted options
- ❌ Using jargon without definition
- ❌ Making them hunt for "so what does this mean?"

## IC & Cross-Functional Communication

**Goal:** Provide context and detail needed for execution

### **PRD/Spec Structure:**
```
PROBLEM: [What user problem are we solving? For whom?]

WHY NOW: [Why is this important? What's the cost of not solving?]

SUCCESS CRITERIA: [How will we know this worked? Specific metrics]

USER EXPERIENCE:
- [User flow or interaction model]
- [Edge cases and error states]

TECHNICAL APPROACH:
- [High-level architecture]
- [Key technical decisions and rationale]

OUT OF SCOPE: [What we're explicitly NOT doing and why]

OPEN QUESTIONS: [What we need to decide/validate]

NEXT STEPS: [Who does what by when]
```

### **Frameworks:**
- **Problem/Solution/Outcome:** Start with why, explain how, define success
- **Jobs-to-be-Done:** Frame work in terms of customer jobs
- **Technical Context → Business Impact:** Connect technical work to value

### **Principles:**
- Provide context—why this matters, what we learned
- Be specific—"reduce p95 latency from 800ms to 200ms" not "improve performance"
- Acknowledge uncertainty—call out assumptions and unknowns
- Connect to strategy—link to vision, OKRs, or strategic initiatives
- Use visuals—diagrams, mockups, data charts over walls of text

### **Anti-patterns:**
- ❌ Assuming everyone has the context you have
- ❌ Spec'ing the solution without explaining the problem
- ❌ Using ambiguous language ("better," "faster," "improved")
- ❌ Skipping edge cases and error states

---

## Customer Communication

**Goal:** Build trust, provide value, drive adoption/retention

### **Product Update Structure:**
```
HEADLINE: [Benefit] + [Availability]
Example: "See delivery risks 3 weeks early—available now"

OPENING: Bridge current pain to new possibility
"Remember when [specific frustration]? That changes today."

VALUE STACK:
✓ [Primary benefit] - [Specific outcome]
✓ [Secondary benefit] - [Efficiency gain]
✓ [Tertiary benefit] - [Strategic advantage]

PROOF: [Early customer result or concrete data]

HOW TO ACCESS: [Specific steps, < 3 clicks]

NEXT STEPS: [Clear CTA with timeline]
```

### **Frameworks:**
- **Before/After/Bridge:** Current pain → Future state → Product as the path
- **PAS (Problem/Agitate/Solution):** Identify pain, make cost clear, offer solution
- **StoryBrand:** Position customer as hero, you as guide

### **Translation Rules:**
```
INSTEAD OF → SAY THIS

API Integration → Connects with tools your team uses
Throughput Optimization → Helps work flow faster
Dependency Mapping → Shows how your work affects other teams
Technical Debt → Shortcuts that slow future work
MVP → Simplest version that solves the core problem
```

### **Principles:**
- Lead with benefit, not feature
- Use customer language, not product terminology
- Quantify impact ("Save 6 hours/week" not "Increase efficiency")
- Make adoption easy—clear, simple steps (< 3)
- Build trust—proof points, customer quotes, real results

### **Anti-patterns:**
- ❌ Leading with features ("We built X")
- ❌ Using internal jargon or acronyms
- ❌ Assuming they know why this matters
- ❌ Making adoption complex (> 3 steps)

## Stakeholder Alignment & Influence

**Goal:** Build coalitions, gain buy-in, navigate politics

### **Alignment Doc Structure:**
```
PURPOSE: [What decision/alignment we need]

CONTEXT: [Why this matters now, what changed]

PROPOSAL: [What you're recommending]

BENEFITS BY STAKEHOLDER:
- [Engineering]: [What they gain]
- [Sales]: [What they gain]
- [Exec team]: [What they gain]

ADDRESSING CONCERNS:
- [Concern 1]: [How we mitigate]
- [Concern 2]: [How we mitigate]

SUCCESS METRICS: [How we'll measure progress]

NEXT STEPS: [Clear path forward]
```

### **Influence Strategies:**
- **Make it their idea:** Ask questions that lead them to your conclusion
- **Align to their goals:** Frame your proposal in terms of what they care about
- **Build coalition first:** Secure key allies before broad communication
- **Address objections proactively:** Surface and resolve concerns early
- **Use their language:** Mirror their terminology and priorities

### **Frameworks:**
- **Narrative Arc:** Story-driven vision that creates emotional connection
- **Intention & Obstacle:** Show what you're trying to achieve and what's blocking you
- **Social Proof:** Leverage authority, peers, consensus to build credibility

### **Principles:**
- Understand motivations—what does each stakeholder care about?
- Frame in their terms—engineering wants feasibility, sales wants competitive advantage
- Build trust through transparency—acknowledge risks and tradeoffs
- Create forcing functions—deadlines, dependencies, external commitments
- Make the default path your desired outcome

### **Anti-patterns:**
- ❌ Assuming logic wins—politics and incentives matter
- ❌ Surprising stakeholders in group settings
- ❌ Ignoring power dynamics and org politics
- ❌ Presenting only upside—acknowledging risks builds credibility

## Communication Anti-Patterns

1. **Burying the Lead:** Saving the most important point for the end
2. **Audience Mismatch:** Using exec frameworks for IC audience (or vice versa)
3. **Missing Evidence:** Claims without sources or data
4. **Ambiguous CTAs:** "Let me know your thoughts" instead of specific asks
5. **Over-Engineering:** 10-page doc when 1-pager + appendix would work
6. **Jargon Overload:** Using terms audience doesn't understand
7. **No Next Steps:** Ending without clear action items
8. **Context Overload:** Providing too much background before the point
