## Decision-Making Principles (Expanded)

### **1. One-Way vs. Two-Way Doors (Bezos Framework)**

**ONE-WAY DOORS (Irreversible or very costly to reverse):**
- Require: 90%+ certainty, broad input, senior approval, thorough analysis
- Speed: Slow and deliberate (days to weeks)
- Examples:
  - Changing pricing model (hard to reverse without customer backlash)
  - Shutting down a product line (can't easily restart)
  - Making a key hire or firing someone (people decisions have long tails)
  - Major architectural decisions (technical debt accumulates)
  - Signing multi-year vendor contracts
  - Entering new markets or verticals

**TWO-WAY DOORS (Reversible or low cost to reverse):**
- Require: 70% certainty, bias for action, fast iteration
- Speed: Fast (hours to days)
- Examples:
  - Feature prioritization (can reprioritize next sprint)
  - UI/UX changes (can revert if data shows problems)
  - Messaging/positioning tests (easily adjusted)
  - Experimental features (can be killed or evolved)
  - Process changes (can be adjusted based on feedback)
  - Most tactical execution decisions

**Decision framework:**
```
Is this decision easily reversible?
  → YES: Decide at 70% certainty, ship fast, learn from data
  → NO: Is reversal very costly (time, money, trust)?
      → YES: One-way door—slow down, gather input, get to 90%+
      → NO: Two-way door—decide and move
```

### **2. The 70% Rule: Decide with Sufficient Certainty**

**The math:**
- Reversible decision at 70% certainty → Ship, learn, adjust (days)
- Waiting to get to 90% certainty → Delayed learning, competitor moves first (weeks)
- Cost of being wrong on reversible decision: Small (can fix quickly)
- Cost of being slow: High (opportunity cost, competitive risk, team momentum)

**70% CERTAINTY CHECKLIST:**
- [ ] Do you understand the problem clearly?
- [ ] Have you considered 2-3 options?
- [ ] Do you know what success looks like?
- [ ] Have you identified key risks?
- [ ] Do you have a plan to mitigate top risks?
- [ ] Can you explain your reasoning?

**If YES to most: You're at 70%. Decide.**

### **3. Decision Ownership: Who Decides?**

**YOU DECIDE (Individual ownership):**
- Your domain/scope of responsibility
- Two-way door decisions
- Tactical execution choices
- When you're the accountable DRI (Directly Responsible Individual)

**ESCALATE (Higher authority needed):**
- One-way doors beyond your scope
- Cross-org dependencies requiring senior alignment
- Major resource commitments
- Strategic pivots
- Decisions that affect other teams' roadmaps

**COLLABORATE (Input needed, but you decide):**
- Cross-functional impact (need eng/design/GTM input)
- Customer-facing changes (need CS/Support input)
- Technical feasibility questions (need eng validation)
- Go-to-market dependencies (need Sales/Marketing input)

**DELEGATE (Someone else owns):**
- Outside your expertise or domain
- When someone else is the DRI
- When team member has better context/judgment

**Decision rights clarity:**
```
For any decision, clarify:
- Who is the DRI (Directly Responsible Individual)?
- Who must be consulted (input required)?
- Who must be informed (FYI only)?
- Who approves (if escalation needed)?
- By when must this be decided?
```

### **4. Disagree and Commit**

**BEFORE DECISION:**
- Encourage vigorous debate
- Surface all concerns and objections
- Pressure-test assumptions
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Make your disagreement clear

**AFTER DECISION:**
- Commit fully to execution
- Support the decision publicly
- Give it a real chance to work
- Don't undermine with "I told you so" energy
- Focus on making it successful

**Framework:**
```
"I hear your concerns about [X]. Here's why I'm deciding [Y] anyway: [rationale].
I need your commitment to make this work. Can I count on you?

We'll revisit this in [timeframe] and check [success criteria].
If I'm wrong, we'll adjust. If you're right, we'll learn from it."
```

### **5. Decision Documentation Template**

```markdown
## Decision: [Clear, specific decision statement]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Owner:** [Name of DRI]
**Type:** One-way door | Two-way door
**Status:** Proposed | Decided | Implemented | Reversed

## Context
[Why are we making this decision now? What changed?]

## Options Considered
1. **[Option A]**: [Description]
   - Pros: [Benefits]
   - Cons: [Drawbacks]

2. **[Option B]**: [Description]
   - Pros: [Benefits]
   - Cons: [Drawbacks]

3. **[Option C - Do Nothing]**: [Always consider]
   - Pros: [Benefits]
   - Cons: [Drawbacks]

## Decision
[What we're doing - be specific and unambiguous]

## Rationale
[Why this option? What principles/evidence drove this?]
- Customer evidence: [What did we learn?]
- Data supporting: [Metrics, research]
- Strategic alignment: [How does this support vision/goals?]
- Key tradeoff: [What are we optimizing for?]

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [How we'll handle it] |
| [Risk 2] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [How we'll handle it] |

## Reversibility
**How hard to reverse:** Easy | Medium | Hard | Irreversible
**Cost to reverse:** [Time, money, trust impact]
**Triggers for re-evaluation:**
- [Condition 1: e.g., if adoption < 20% after 30 days]
- [Condition 2: e.g., if customer churn increases > 5%]

## Success Criteria
**How will we know this was right?**
- [Metric 1]: [Target] by [date]
- [Metric 2]: [Target] by [date]
- [Qualitative signal]: [What we'll observe]

**Review date:** [When we'll formally assess this decision]

## Stakeholders
- **Decided:** [DRI who made the call]
- **Consulted:** [Who provided input]
- **Informed:** [Who needs to know]
- **Disagreed but committed:** [Who disagreed but is supporting]
```

### **6. Decision Velocity: Speed as a Competitive Advantage**

**REDUCE DECISION LATENCY:**
- Set decision deadlines: "We'll decide by Friday"
- Time-box analysis: "Spend 2 hours on this, then decide"
- Limit options: Max 3 options (status quo always one of them)
- Parallel input-gathering: Don't wait sequentially for each stakeholder

**ELIMINATE FAKE WORK:**
- Don't create decks for decisions that could be docs
- Don't schedule meetings for decisions that could be async
- Don't gather data you won't use
- Don't include stakeholders who don't add value

**CREATE DECISION FORCING FUNCTIONS:**
- External deadlines (customer commitments, launches)
- Default decisions: "If we don't decide by X, the default is Y"
- Escalation paths: "I'll decide by EOD unless you override"
- Timeboxed collaboration: "We'll discuss for 30 min, then I'm calling it"

**EMPOWER OTHERS TO DECIDE:**
- Delegate two-way door decisions
- Create clear decision authorities
- Trust your team's judgment
- Review outcomes, not decisions (manage through learning)

### **7. Learning from Decisions: Close the Loop**

**REVIEW FRAMEWORK:**
```
DECISION REVIEW: [Decision Name]
**Original decision date:** [Date]
**Review date:** [Today]

## Outcome Assessment
**Did we achieve success criteria?**
- [Metric 1]: Target [X], Actual [Y] → Met/Missed/Exceeded
- [Metric 2]: Target [X], Actual [Y] → Met/Missed/Exceeded

**What actually happened?**
[Narrative: What resulted from this decision?]

## What We Learned
**What did we get right?**
- [Insight 1]
- [Insight 2]

**What did we get wrong?**
- [Assumption that didn't hold]
- [Risk we underestimated]

**What would we do differently?**
- [Adjustment 1]
- [Adjustment 2]

## Update Beliefs
**What does this teach us about future decisions?**
- [Pattern or principle to apply going forward]

## Action Items
- [ ] [If we need to reverse/adjust the decision]
- [ ] [If we need to double down]
- [ ] [If we need to update our decision framework]
```

**SCHEDULE DECISION REVIEWS:**
- For two-way doors: Review in 30-60 days
- For one-way doors: Review in 90-180 days
- Set calendar reminder when documenting decision
- Make review non-negotiable (even when busy)

## Decision-Making Anti-Patterns

1. **Analysis Paralysis:** Waiting for 100% certainty on reversible decisions
2. **Committee Decision:** No clear DRI, everyone has veto power
3. **Default to Status Quo:** Inaction is easier than action
4. **Sunk Cost Thinking:** Continuing because of past investment
5. **No Success Criteria:** Can't evaluate if decision was right
6. **No Review Loop:** Decisions made but never evaluated
7. **Premature Escalation:** Escalating decisions you should own
8. **Undocumented Decisions:** Forgotten rationale, no learning
