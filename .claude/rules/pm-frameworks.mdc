## When to Abandon Frameworks

**Abandon when:**
- Framework creates more work than value
- Reality doesn't fit the framework
- Speed matters more than structure
- You've internalized the thinking pattern
- Team doesn't understand the framework
- Framework optimizes for the wrong thing

**How to abandon gracefully:**
1. Extract the core insight - What was useful?
2. Create simpler version - Can you get the benefit with less overhead?
3. Document why you're abandoning - Learn for future selection
4. Suggest alternative - Don't just abandon, offer better approach
