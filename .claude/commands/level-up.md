# Level Up

The 10 Levels of Claude Code. Scan your environment, determine where you actually are, get a focused roadmap to the next level, and optionally build the first step right now.

These levels measure **environment maturity**, not personal skill. A senior engineer with a bare install is Level 0. A junior dev with a well-built system of skills, memory and automation could be Level 7. The question isn't "how good are you at coding?" It's "how much have you built around Claude Code to make it work for you?"

This is NOT the generic "10 Levels of Claude" (browser, desktop, projects). This is specifically about your Claude Code setup. Level 0 is "just installed it." Level 10 is genuinely rare.

**Usage:**
- `/level-up` - Full flow: assess, roadmap, build
- `/level-up --assess` - Just show your current level
- `/level-up --build` - Skip assessment, jump to building

---

## How It Works

```
Scan Environment → Determine Level → Show Roadmap → Build First Step
       ↓                 ↓                ↓               ↓
   Phase 1           Phase 1          Phase 2          Phase 3
   (automatic)       (+ 3 questions)  (next level)     (optional)
```

Designed to be run repeatedly. Every time you level up, the assessment updates.

## The 10 Levels of Claude Code

| Level | Name | What It Means (Plain English) |
|-------|------|-------------------------------|
| 0 | Terminal Tourist | You just installed it. You're typing prompts like it's ChatGPT but in a terminal. No setup, no config. That's fine, everyone starts here. |
| 1 | Grounded | You've created a CLAUDE.md file so Claude actually knows who you are and what you want. You know the basic commands. This alone makes a huge difference. |
| 2 | Connected | Claude can read your actual tools: your Slack, your Drive, your Notion, your Gmail. You're not copy-pasting context anymore. It just pulls what it needs. |
| 3 | Skilled | You've built reusable commands (skills) you run regularly. Instead of re-explaining the same task every session, you type `/research` or `/review` and it just works. |
| 4 | Context Architect | You've built a structured knowledge system: memory files, patterns, client profiles, examples. Claude doesn't just follow instructions, it draws from everything you've taught it. Output gets better over time. |
| 5 | System Builder | Your skills chain together. One feeds into the next. You use sub-agents for parallel work. You have approval gates so nothing ships without your sign-off. This is where Claude feels like a team, not a tool. |
| 6 | Pipeline Engineer | You're calling Claude from scripts. Headless mode, JSON output, piping data through it programmatically. Claude is a component in your automation stack, not just a chat window. |
| 7 | Browser Commander | Claude controls a browser. It scrapes websites, takes screenshots, generates PDFs, builds carousels. Research pipelines that crawl the web and turn findings into deliverables. |
| 8 | Multi-Agent Operator | Multiple Claude instances running simultaneously. Each one is a specialist. You coordinate them like a team lead. They share work through files and git. |
| 9 | Always On | Claude runs on a schedule whether you're at your desk or not. Cron jobs, background agents, automated monitoring. It's infrastructure now, not a tool you open. |
| 10 | Swarm Architect | Agents that manage other agents. Autonomous execution loops. Give it a goal and it works toward it, spawning sub-agents as needed. Genuinely rare. Maybe a handful of people on the planet. |

Most users land between Level 1 and 4. Level 5 is strong. Level 7+ is rare.

## Phase 1: Assess Your Level

### Step 1.1: Environment Scan

Silently scan the user's environment. Do NOT ask permission for each check. Just read what's available.

**Check all of these:**

```
1. CLAUDE.md (check ALL locations)
   - Check: CLAUDE.md, .claude/CLAUDE.md, CLAUDE.local.md, ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
   - Does any exist? How many locations are used?
   - How many lines total? (< 10 = minimal, 10-50 = basic, 50-150 = solid, 150+ = advanced)
   - Does it reference memory files, patterns, workflows?
   - Does it have navigation tables, progressive disclosure, workflow instructions?

2. Skills / Commands
   - Check both .claude/commands/ AND .claude/skills/ directories
   - Count total skills
   - Read 2-3 to check complexity:
     * Simple (< 20 lines, single prompt) = Level 3
     * Medium (20-80 lines, multi-step) = Level 3-4
     * Complex (80+ lines, phases, approval gates, tool calls) = Level 5+
     * Skills that call other skills or orchestrate sub-agents = Level 5-6

3. MCP Configuration
   - Check .mcp.json in current directory (project-level)
   - Check ~/.claude.json for mcpServers (user-level)
   - Optionally check managed config if enterprise
   - Count configured MCP servers across all locations
   - Categorize: data (Notion, Drive), comms (Slack, Gmail), dev (GitHub, Supabase), browser (Puppeteer, Chrome), specialty (PostHog, GSC)

4. Memory / Context Structure
   - Is there a memory/ directory?
   - How deep? (flat files = Level 4, nested dirs like memory/patterns/, memory/customers/, memory/examples/ = Level 4-5)
   - Are there templates, workflows, experience directories?
   - Does the CLAUDE.md reference and route to memory files?

5. Quality Gate Signals (Level 5+)
   - Hook configurations in .claude/settings.json? (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, etc.)
   - Agent definitions in .claude/agents/ or ~/.claude/agents/?
   - Hooks are quality gates, not infrastructure. They belong here, not at Level 9.

6. Automation Signals (Level 6+)
   - Any shell scripts that call `claude -p` or `claude --print`?
   - Any package.json with Playwright or Puppeteer?
   - Any screenshot scripts, PDF generators, scraping tools?
   - Evidence of JSON output piping?
   - Chrome browser integration enabled (CLI flags)?

7. Multi-Agent Signals (Level 8+)
   - tmux config files or scripts?
   - Multiple CLAUDE.md files for different agent roles?
   - VPS deployment evidence?

8. Always-On Signals (Level 9-10)
   - Cron jobs, launchd services, or systemd services calling Claude on a schedule?
   - Background agents running 24/7 (pm2, systemd)?
   - Autonomous loop scripts (PRD + test suite patterns)?
   - Agent orchestration configs (Agent Teams, Gastown, OpenClaw)?
   - Evidence of agents managing other agents?
```

### Step 1.2: Context Questions

Ask the user these 3 questions:

1. **What do you mainly use Claude Code for?** (coding / content creation / research / automation / business operations / other)
2. **What's your biggest friction right now?** (output quality / context limits / don't know what's possible / speed / reliability)
3. **If you could automate one thing you do repeatedly, what would it be?**

### Step 1.3: Determine Level

Use this scoring system. The user's level is determined by the HIGHEST level where they meet ALL criteria:

| Level | Required Signals |
|-------|-----------------|
| 0 | No CLAUDE.md, no .claude/ directory |
| 1 | CLAUDE.md exists (any size). Knows basic slash commands. |
| 2 | .mcp.json with 1+ working MCP servers. Pulling real data into sessions. |
| 3 | 3+ custom skills in .claude/commands/ or .claude/skills/. Uses them regularly. |
| 4 | Structured memory/ directory with patterns, examples, or knowledge files. CLAUDE.md references them. Context architecture, not just a config file. |
| 5 | Complex multi-phase skills (80+ lines). Skills chain together (output of one feeds another). Evidence of subagent usage or agent definitions in .claude/agents/. Hook configurations for quality gates. Consistent production-quality output. |
| 6 | Shell scripts or automation calling `claude -p`. JSON output piping. Programmatic integration beyond interactive use. |
| 7 | Browser automation in project (Playwright, Puppeteer, or Chrome integration). Screenshot automation, PDF generation, web scraping workflows. Browser-powered pipelines. |
| 8 | tmux multi-session setups. Multiple parallel CC instances. Different agent roles. VPS or remote deployment. |
| 9 | Cron jobs or scheduled tasks running CC. Background agents running 24/7. CC as persistent infrastructure, not a tool you open. |
| 10 | Autonomous execution loops. Multi-agent orchestration frameworks. Agents spawning and managing other agents. Safety boundaries and rollback systems. |

**Important:** Having lots of files doesn't automatically mean advanced. 50 simple skills is still Level 3. The complexity and integration between components matters more than quantity.

### Step 1.4: Present the Assessment

Show the user their level with clear reasoning. The goal is to make them feel understood, not judged. Explain WHY each thing matters, not just that you found it.

```
## Your Claude Code Level: [X] / 10

**[Level Name]**

### Here's why you're at Level [X]:

Walk through the levels one by one, bottom to top, showing what you found for each:

**Level 0 (Terminal Tourist): ✓ You're past this.**
You have [specific thing], so you're clearly not just typing into a terminal with no setup.

**Level 1 (Grounded): ✓ Covered.**
Your CLAUDE.md [describe what it looks like: how long, what's in it, how detailed].
This means Claude actually knows [what it knows about them]. That's the foundation.

**Level 2 (Connected): ✓ Covered.**
You have [X] MCP servers: [list them]. That means Claude can directly [what those MCPs enable: read your Slack, check your email, pull from Notion, etc.]. You're not copy-pasting context anymore.

[Continue for each level they've achieved...]

**Level [X+1] ([Name]): ✗ This is where it stops.**
[Explain plainly what's missing and WHY it matters. Don't just say "no headless scripts found." Say something like: "Right now you're doing everything interactively. You open Claude, type a command, wait for output. Level 6 is about making Claude work without you sitting there. You'd write a script that calls Claude, processes the output, and saves it somewhere. Like a morning briefing that generates itself before you wake up. I didn't find any scripts like that in your setup."]

### The short version:
[One paragraph summary. Example: "You've got a solid foundation: Claude knows who you are, it can pull from your real tools, and you've built workflows that run on command. That's strong. What you're missing is the jump from interactive to programmatic. Everything still requires you to be in the chair typing commands."]

### Where that puts you:
Most Claude Code users land between Level 1 and 4. At Level [X], you're [ahead of most / in the middle / at the frontier / etc.].
```

**Tone rules:**
- Talk to them like a knowledgeable friend, not a grading rubric
- Explain things like you're talking to someone smart who just hasn't seen this particular thing before
- If something is impressive, say so genuinely
- If something is messy or could be better, say that too, but constructively
- Use "you" and "your", not "the user"
- Avoid jargon without explanation. If you mention "headless mode" also say "that means running Claude from a script instead of typing into the terminal"
- The goal is: after reading this, they understand exactly what they have, what they're missing, and why the next level matters

If `--assess` flag was used, stop here. Otherwise continue to Phase 2.

---

## Phase 2: Your Roadmap

Show ONLY the next level transition. Do not dump all 10 levels. Focus is everything.

**Pick the matching section below based on assessed level.**

---

### Level 0 → Level 1: Get Grounded

**What this unlocks:** Claude remembers your preferences, follows your rules, produces consistent output instead of generic responses every session.

**Your roadmap:**

1. **Create your CLAUDE.md** (10 minutes)
   - This is the single most important file. Claude reads it at the start of every session.
   - Include: who you are, what you do, your communication preferences, your project context, rules for output quality.
   - Think of it as onboarding a new team member. What would they need to know on day one?

2. **Set up your project folder** (2 minutes)
   - Create a dedicated folder for your main work.
   - Initialize git: `git init` (Claude Code works best in git repos, it tracks changes).
   - Put your CLAUDE.md at the root.

3. **Learn the essential commands** (5 minutes)
   - `/compact` compresses your conversation to save context space
   - `/model` switches between Opus (deep reasoning), Sonnet (daily work), Haiku (quick tasks)
   - `/cost` shows how much you've spent this session
   - `/help` shows everything available

4. **Run a real task** (10 minutes)
   - Don't start with toy problems. Give it something you actually need done.
   - Notice how it follows your CLAUDE.md rules.

**Community tip:** "The quality of your repository dictates the quality of your output." Members who invested 30 minutes in their CLAUDE.md before doing anything else got dramatically better results from day one.

**Common mistake:** Writing a CLAUDE.md that's too vague. "Be helpful" means nothing. "Always write in short paragraphs, use data to support claims, never use jargon" means everything.

---

### Level 1 → Level 2: Connect Your Data

**What this unlocks:** Claude reads your actual Slack messages, Notion pages, Google Docs, Gmail. No more copy-pasting context. It just knows.

**Your roadmap:**

1. **Pick your first MCP** (5 minutes)
   - MCP stands for "Model Context Protocol." In plain English: it's a plugin that lets Claude directly read and write to your tools. Instead of you copying a Slack message and pasting it into Claude, an MCP lets Claude go read Slack itself.
   - Pick the tool you use most: Google Drive, Notion, Slack, or Gmail.

2. **Add it to your config** (5 minutes)
   - You tell Claude about your MCPs by adding them to a settings file called `.mcp.json`. Think of it like a contact list: you're giving Claude the address of each tool so it knows how to reach it.
   - Create `.mcp.json` in your project root (or add to `~/.claude.json` for global access).
   - Example structure:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "google-drive": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@anthropic-ai/google-drive-mcp"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   - Restart Claude Code after adding.

3. **Test it with a real task** (5 minutes)
   - Just ask Claude something that requires your tool. If it works, the MCP is connected:
   - "Summarize the last 5 messages in #general on Slack"
   - "What are the action items from my last meeting notes in Notion?"
   - "Draft a reply to the last email from [name]"

4. **Add a second MCP** (5 minutes)
   - Two connected data sources is where the magic starts. Claude can cross-reference: "Based on the Slack discussion AND the Notion brief, draft the proposal."

**Community tip:** Don't install 15 MCPs on day one. Tijmen discovered that too many MCPs bloat your starting context. Claude Code's tool search feature helps (dropped context from 51% to 13%), but fewer is still better. Start with 1-2 that match your daily work.

**Best first combos:**
- Content creators: Google Drive + Notion
- Marketers: Slack + Google Drive
- Developers: GitHub + Supabase
- Consultants: Notion + Gmail + Slack

---

### Level 2 → Level 3: Build Your Skills

**What this unlocks:** Repeatable workflows you trigger with a single command. Instead of re-explaining tasks every session, you type `/review` or `/research` and it runs the whole thing.

**Your roadmap:**

1. **Identify your most repeated task** (5 minutes)
   - Think about what you keep explaining to Claude over and over. "Research this company and give me a summary." "Review this document for quality." "Write a LinkedIn post in my voice." If you've said it more than twice, it should be a skill.

2. **Create the skill file** (10 minutes)
   - A skill is just a text file with instructions. You write down what you want Claude to do, step by step, and save it as a file. Then instead of typing those instructions every time, you just type `/name` and Claude follows the instructions automatically.
   - Create `.claude/commands/` directory if it doesn't exist.
   - Create a markdown file: `.claude/commands/[name].md` (for example, `research.md`)
   - Structure:
   ```markdown
   ---
   description: What this skill does in one line
   ---

   # [Skill Name]

   [2-3 sentences: what this does and when to use it]

   ## Steps

   1. [First thing Claude should do]
   2. [Second thing]
   3. [Third thing]

   ## Output Format

   [Describe what the final output should look like]

   ## Rules

   - [Important constraint 1]
   - [Important constraint 2]
   ```

3. **Test and iterate** (5 minutes)
   - Type `/[name]` to run it. Claude reads your instructions and follows them.
   - First version won't be perfect. Run it, see what's off, edit the .md file. The skill improves every time you tweak it.

4. **Build 2-3 more skills** (ongoing)
   - Most people start with three: one for research, one for creating something, one for reviewing quality. Once you have those, they start feeding into each other naturally.

**Community tip:** Skills turn Claude into a team member who never forgets the process. After building 5+ skills, output consistency goes from "hit or miss" to "reliable every time."

**Note on terminology:** "Custom commands" and "skills" are the same thing. Files in `.claude/commands/` and `.claude/skills/` both create slash commands.

---

### Level 3 → Level 4: Become a Context Architect

**What this unlocks:** A persistent knowledge system. Claude doesn't just follow instructions. It draws from your accumulated knowledge, patterns, client history and examples to produce work that improves over time.

**What "context architecture" actually means:** Right now, every time you start a new Claude session, it starts fresh. It doesn't remember what you did last week. A context architecture is a folder of files that Claude reads at the start of every session: who your clients are, what approaches you use, examples of your best work. It's like giving a new employee a handbook on day one instead of re-training them every morning.

**Your roadmap:**

1. **Create your knowledge folders** (20 minutes)
   - Make a `memory/` folder in your project with subfolders for different types of knowledge:
   ```
   memory/
   ├── company/        # About your business, your positioning, your offers
   ├── customers/      # One file per client: who they are, what you're doing for them
   ├── patterns/       # Approaches that work: "how I run a strategy call," "how I write proposals"
   └── examples/       # Your best past work that Claude can use as a reference
   ```
   - Each file is just a plain text document. Keep them focused: one topic per file.

2. **Point Claude to your knowledge** (10 minutes)
   - Update your CLAUDE.md so it tells Claude where to find things. Add a section like "Before starting client work, read memory/customers/[client name]." This way Claude knows to check your notes before it starts working.

3. **Write down what you know** (30 minutes)
   - Start with 5 things you do the same way every time: how you structure a proposal, how you run a meeting, how you write a LinkedIn post. Save each one as a file in memory/patterns/.
   - Save 3-5 examples of your best output. Claude will use these as a reference for quality and style.

4. **Build the feedback loop** (ongoing)
   - After every project, save what worked. Your system gets smarter with every project. This is where the compounding starts: month one feels slow, month two you notice the difference.

**Community tip:** "I moved my entire business into GitHub. Everything is a repo." The members running structured knowledge systems report 3-5x productivity gains after the first month of accumulation.

**The formula:** Context quality = output quality. This is not prompt engineering. This is context engineering.

---

### Level 4 → Level 5: Build Systems, Not Skills

**What this unlocks:** Instead of running one skill at a time, your skills work together like an assembly line. You become the person who designs the system, not the person who runs each step.

**What "systems" means here:** At Level 3-4, you have individual skills: `/research`, `/create`, `/review`. At Level 5, these connect. Research automatically feeds into creation, which automatically gets reviewed. You also have "subagents," which are like assistants that Claude spins up to handle parts of the work in parallel. One researches while another writes. And you have "hooks," which are automatic safety checks that run every time Claude does something: like a spell-checker that runs every time you save a document.

**Your roadmap:**

1. **Add phases to your skills** (15 minutes)
   - Right now your skills probably do everything in one go. Break them into phases with checkpoints where Claude pauses and asks "does this look right?" before continuing. This prevents Claude from going off-track for 10 minutes before you notice.
   ```markdown
   ## Phase 1: Research
   [Steps...]
   **Approval gate:** Show me what you found. Wait for my OK before continuing.

   ## Phase 2: Create
   [Steps...]
   **Approval gate:** Show me the draft. Wait for my OK before finalizing.

   ## Phase 3: Review
   [Steps...]
   ```

2. **Connect your skills together** (10 minutes)
   - Design skills so the output of one becomes the input of the next. Your `/research` skill saves a brief. Your `/create` skill reads that brief and uses it. Your `/review` skill checks the final output. It's a pipeline: each step feeds the next.

3. **Use subagents for parallel work** (10 minutes)
   - A subagent is a separate Claude instance that runs alongside your main session. Think of it like delegating: "You go research the competitor while I work on the proposal." Claude can spin these up inside your skills. One subagent researches, another writes, another reviews: all at the same time.
   - Define agent roles in `.claude/agents/` so each one has its own personality and expertise.

4. **Set up automatic safety checks** (10 minutes)
   - Hooks are rules that run automatically before or after Claude does something. For example: "Before writing any file, check it's not a password file." Or: "After editing code, run the linter." You configure these in `.claude/settings.json`. They're like guardrails that prevent mistakes without you having to watch every action.

5. **Quality systems** (ongoing)
   - Build review checklists into your skills. Point Claude to your memory/examples/ files so it knows what "good" looks like. Output should be ready to send to a client, not "good enough."

**Community tip:** The jump from Level 4 to 5 is where Claude Code stops feeling like a tool and starts feeling like a team. The key is building the orchestration layer, not just having more skills.

---

### Level 5 → Level 6: Programmatic Pipelines

**What this unlocks:** Claude works without you being there. You write a script once, and it runs Claude automatically whenever you want: every morning, before every meeting, on demand from your phone.

**What "headless mode" actually means:** Normally you open Claude Code, type something, and wait for a response. That's "interactive mode": you're sitting there having a conversation. "Headless mode" means you run Claude from a script instead. No conversation, no typing. You give it a task in advance, it does the work, and saves the result to a file. You come back later and the work is done. It's the difference between calling someone on the phone vs. sending them a task by email.

**Your roadmap:**

1. **Try headless mode once** (5 minutes)
   - Instead of opening Claude Code and typing, run this one line in your terminal:
   ```bash
   claude -p "Analyze all files in /src and write a security audit to audit.md"
   ```
   - That's it. Claude reads the task, does the work, and saves the output. No conversation needed. The `-p` flag means "just do this task and finish."
   - **Important:** Your slash commands (like `/lookout`) only work in interactive mode. In headless mode, you either describe the task in plain English or feed it the skill file directly: `claude -p "$(cat .claude/commands/lookout.md)"`

2. **Write your first automation script** (15 minutes)
   - A script is just a text file with a list of commands your computer runs in order. You write it once and can run it whenever you want with a single click or command. Here's what one looks like:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # This script generates a morning briefing automatically.
   # You run it by typing: bash morning-briefing.sh
   # Or you can schedule it to run every morning at 7am (that's Level 9).
   claude -p "Read my latest emails and Slack messages, write a morning briefing to briefing.md" \
     --allowedTools "Read,Write,Glob,Grep,mcp__google__gmail_search_messages"
   ```
   - Save this as a file (e.g. `morning-briefing.sh`), then run it with `bash morning-briefing.sh`. Claude does the work and saves the result. You don't need to be watching.

3. **Chain outputs together** (10 minutes)
   - You can make Claude output structured data (JSON) instead of plain text, then feed that into another tool or another Claude call. Think of it like an assembly line: step 1 gathers data, step 2 analyzes it, step 3 creates the report. Each step runs automatically.

4. **Integrate with your existing tools** (ongoing)
   - Once you're comfortable with scripts, you can plug Claude into anything: automatically review code when someone submits a change, generate reports from your database, process incoming data.

**Community tip:** Level 6 is where most people who do real automation work land. It's the practical ceiling for most use cases. Beyond here, you're building infrastructure.

---

### Level 6 → Level 7: Browser Power

**What this unlocks:** Claude can open a web browser, visit websites, read what's on the page, take screenshots, and generate PDFs. It can research companies by actually visiting their website instead of relying on what it already knows.

**What "browser automation" actually means:** You know how you open Chrome, go to a website, scroll around, and copy information? Browser automation means Claude does that same thing, but programmatically. It opens a real browser (you just can't see it), navigates to pages, reads the content, and brings back what it found. It can also take a screenshot of an HTML file you created and turn it into an image or PDF.

**Your roadmap:**

1. **Install browser tools** (5 minutes)
   - Run `npm install playwright` in your project, then `npx playwright install chromium`. This installs a browser that Claude can control. Think of it like giving Claude its own Chrome window.
   - Alternatively, enable Chrome integration via Claude Code CLI flags (`--browser`).

2. **Screenshot and PDF generation** (10 minutes)
   - Build skills that create an HTML page (like a deck or report), then screenshot it into a clean image or PDF. This is how you make professional-looking deliverables without Canva or PowerPoint.

3. **Web research workflows** (15 minutes)
   - Build a skill where Claude visits a company's website, reads their pages, checks their LinkedIn, and synthesizes everything into a brief. Instead of relying on its training data (which might be outdated), it's reading the live website.

4. **Research pipelines** (ongoing)
   - Combine browser + your other tools: Claude scrapes a website, saves the findings to Notion, and alerts you via Slack. Competitive intelligence on demand.

**Community tip:** This is the level where Claude Code starts replacing paid SaaS tools. Members have canceled Gamma (decks), Canva Pro (design), Superhuman (email) after building equivalent browser-powered workflows.

---

### Level 7 → Level 8: Multi-Agent Operations

**What this unlocks:** Multiple Claude Code sessions running at the same time, each doing different work. Like having a team of specialists working in parallel.

**What "multi-agent" actually means:** Imagine you have three employees. One is researching a competitor, one is writing a proposal, and one is reviewing last week's deliverable. They're all working at the same time on different tasks. That's what multi-agent means: you open multiple Claude Code windows and give each one a different job. They work simultaneously, and you coordinate the results.

**Your roadmap:**

1. **Open multiple Claude sessions at once** (10 minutes)
   - Use a tool called tmux (a terminal multiplier: it splits your terminal screen into multiple panels). Each panel runs its own Claude Code session. One researches, another writes, another reviews: all at the same time.
   ```bash
   tmux new-session -s orchestrator
   # Split panes: Ctrl+B then %
   # Each pane runs: cd /project && claude
   ```

2. **Give each session a role** (15 minutes)
   - Each Claude session gets its own instructions. One is the "researcher" (only gathers information), one is the "writer" (only creates content), one is the "reviewer" (only checks quality). They pass work between each other through shared files in your project folder.

3. **Move to a cloud server** (30 minutes)
   - Instead of running everything on your laptop, you rent a small cloud server (a VPS: a computer in the cloud that's always on). You set up Claude Code there and access it from your phone or any computer via an app like Termius. Your agents are always available, even when your laptop is closed.

4. **Coordination patterns** (ongoing)
   - The tricky part isn't running multiple agents: it's making sure they don't step on each other's work. Use shared task files, separate git branches per agent, and a review step before merging anything.

**Community tip:** R moved his entire business to this model. "We've all become endpoint facilitators for our agents. We're context generators, for now." This level requires discipline. Multiple agents without coordination create chaos, not productivity.

---

### Level 8 → Level 9: Always On

**What this unlocks:** Claude runs on a schedule whether you're at your desk or not. Like having an employee who works night shifts: they do the routine work while you sleep, and the results are waiting for you in the morning.

**What "always on" actually means:** At every previous level, you start Claude, give it work, and close it when you're done. At Level 9, Claude runs on a timer. Your computer (or cloud server) automatically starts Claude at specific times: 7am every morning, every Monday at noon, every hour. It does the work, saves the results, and stops. You never opened it or typed anything. It's like setting an alarm clock, but instead of waking you up, it wakes up Claude.

**Your roadmap:**

1. **Schedule a task to run automatically** (15 minutes)
   - Your computer has a built-in scheduler (called "cron" on Mac/Linux). You tell it: "At 7am every weekday, run this script." The script calls Claude in headless mode, Claude does the work, saves the output. You wake up and the briefing is already there.
   ```bash
   # This line tells your computer: at 7am every day, run Claude and generate a briefing
   0 7 * * * cd /project && claude -p "Generate morning briefing" >> /logs/briefing.log
   ```
   - On macOS, launchd (another scheduler) is more reliable than cron. Either works.

2. **Keep agents running continuously** (15 minutes)
   - Instead of running Claude once and stopping, you can keep it running all the time using tools like pm2 (a process manager: it keeps programs alive and restarts them if they crash). Claude watches for new tasks in a file or queue and processes them as they appear. Like a customer service rep who's always on shift.

3. **Monitoring and alerting** (15 minutes)
   - Claude checks your data sources on a schedule and pings you when something needs attention. Example: every morning, check competitor pricing and alert you if anything changed. Or: scan your Slack channels for unanswered questions.

**Community tip:** Level 9 is where the line between "using a tool" and "running an AI system" disappears. Most people don't need this. If your work is project-based, Level 5-7 is the sweet spot. Level 9 is for people running continuous operations.

### Level 9 → Level 10: Swarm Architecture

**What this unlocks:** You give Claude a goal, and it figures out how to get there on its own. It breaks the goal into tasks, assigns them to other Claude instances, reviews the results, and keeps going until the goal is met. You check in periodically, but you're not driving.

**What "swarm" actually means:** At Level 8, you manually set up multiple Claude sessions and tell each one what to do. At Level 10, one "boss" Claude does that for you. You say "build this feature" and the boss Claude breaks it into pieces, spins up worker Claudes to handle each piece, checks their work, and assembles the final result. It's managing a team of AI agents the way a project manager manages a team of people, except the project manager is also AI.

**Your roadmap:**

1. **The autonomous loop** (advanced)
   - Give Claude a document describing what you want built, plus a set of tests that define "done." Claude picks a task, does the work, runs the tests. If they pass, it commits and moves to the next task. If they fail, it fixes the issue and tries again. It keeps going until everything passes.
   - Safety checklist (this is important because you're letting Claude work unsupervised):
     - Always run in a sandboxed environment (an isolated copy, not your main project)
     - Set clear boundaries on what it can modify
     - Review its work before it goes live
     - Set a maximum number of attempts so it doesn't loop forever
     - Keep a kill switch accessible so you can stop it anytime

2. **Agent orchestration frameworks**
   - The community is testing tools that make this easier: frameworks where you define agent roles and the system handles coordination. Each agent has its own instructions, its own memory, its own skills. The orchestrator assigns work and reviews results.

3. **Agent-to-agent communication**
   - Agents talk to each other through shared files. One agent writes a task list, another picks up items, does the work, and marks them done. They coordinate through your project folder and git branches, like coworkers using a shared task board.

4. **Always-on assistants**
   - OpenClaw: an open source framework that runs Claude as a persistent assistant you can message via WhatsApp or Telegram. You text it like a colleague. It's always available, always has your context.

**Community tip:** Level 10 is experimental. The community is actively building and testing these patterns. Things break. The value is in the learning. Very few people are here, and those who are spend significant time managing the systems. This is not "set and forget." This is "build, monitor, iterate."

## Generate Dashboard

After completing Phase 1 (assessment) and Phase 2 (roadmap), ALWAYS generate an HTML dashboard and open it in the browser. This is not optional. Every `/level-up` run ends with a visual dashboard.

### Instructions

1. Build a single self-contained HTML file using the template below
2. Replace ALL placeholder tokens with actual assessment data
3. Write it to `~/Desktop/level-up-results.html`
4. Open it in the browser (platform-aware: `open` on macOS, `xdg-open` on Linux, `start` on Windows/WSL)
5. Tell the user it's open and print the file path

### Placeholder Tokens

Replace these in the HTML template with real values from your assessment:

- `{{LEVEL_NUMBER}}` — The assessed level (0-10)
- `{{LEVEL_NAME}}` — The level name (e.g. "Browser Commander")
- `{{SUMMARY_TEXT}}` — The "short version" paragraph from Step 1.4
- `{{CAPABILITY_CARDS}}` — HTML for each detected capability (see card format below)
- `{{NEXT_LEVEL_NUMBER}}` — Current level + 1
- `{{NEXT_LEVEL_NAME}}` — Name of the next level
- `{{GAP_EXPLANATION}}` — Plain English explanation of what's missing (from Step 1.4)
- `{{ROADMAP_STEPS}}` — HTML for each roadmap step (see step format below)
- `{{PROGRESS_DOTS}}` — HTML for the 0-10 progress dots (see dot format below)
- `{{LEVELS_TABLE_ROWS}}` — HTML rows for the reference table

### Card Format (for {{CAPABILITY_CARDS}})

Generate one card per detected capability. Categories: CLAUDE.md, MCPs, Skills, Memory, Automation, Browser, Workflows, Templates.

```html
<div class="cap-card">
  <div class="cap-icon">✓</div>
  <div class="cap-title">CLAUDE.MD</div>
  <div class="cap-detail">181 lines, advanced<br>References memory, patterns, workflows</div>
</div>
```

For missing capabilities (levels above the user), use this variant:

```html
<div class="cap-card missing">
  <div class="cap-icon">✗</div>
  <div class="cap-title">HOOKS</div>
  <div class="cap-detail">No hook configurations found<br>settings.json is empty</div>
</div>
```

### Step Format (for {{ROADMAP_STEPS}})

Generate one step per roadmap item from Phase 2:

```html
<div class="step">
  <div class="step-num">1</div>
  <div class="step-body">
    <div class="step-title">Configure hooks</div>
    <div class="step-desc">Your .claude/settings.json is empty. Hooks let you auto-run things before or after Claude acts. Start with a post-edit hook that auto-formats files.</div>
    <div class="step-time">~10 minutes</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

If the roadmap step includes a code example, add it inside step-body wrapped in a code-wrapper with a copy button:

```html
<div class="code-wrapper">
<pre class="step-code">claude -p "/lookout" --output-format json > ~/briefing.md</pre>
<button class="copy-btn" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
</div>
```

### Dot Format (for {{PROGRESS_DOTS}})

Generate 11 dots (0-10). Completed levels get class "done", current level gets "current", future levels get no extra class:

```html
<div class="dot done"><span>0</span></div>
<div class="dot done"><span>1</span></div>
<!-- ... -->
<div class="dot current"><span>7</span></div>
<div class="dot"><span>8</span></div>
<!-- ... -->
<div class="dot"><span>10</span></div>
```

### Levels Table Rows (for {{LEVELS_TABLE_ROWS}})

One row per level. Current level gets class "current-row":

```html
<tr>
  <td class="lvl-num">0</td>
  <td class="lvl-name">Terminal Tourist</td>
  <td class="lvl-desc">Just installed it. Typing prompts like ChatGPT in a terminal.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="current-row">
  <td class="lvl-num">7</td>
  <td class="lvl-name">Browser Commander</td>
  <td class="lvl-desc">Browser control, screenshots, PDF generation, scraping workflows.</td>
</tr>
```

### HTML Template

Write this exact template, replacing all `{{TOKENS}}` with generated content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

### After Writing the HTML

1. Write the completed HTML (with all tokens replaced) to `~/Desktop/level-up-results.html`
2. Open it: run `open ~/Desktop/level-up-results.html` via Bash
3. Tell the user: "Your level-up dashboard is open in the browser."

---

## Phase 3: Build It Now

**Ask the user:** "Want me to build the first step of your roadmap right now?"

If yes, execute the matching build step below. If no, end with the roadmap summary.

---

### Build: CLAUDE.md Starter (for Level 0)

Create a CLAUDE.md in the current project root using the context questions:

```markdown
# [Project/Business Name]

## About
- **Role:** [from Q1 answer]
- **Main work:** [from Q1 answer]
- **Key tools:** [detected from environment]

## Communication Style
- [Infer from conversation]
- Be direct and actionable
- Use plain language

## Project Context
[Based on files and structure detected]

## Output Rules
- [Address their biggest friction from Q2]
- Always be specific, not vague
- Include examples when explaining concepts

## What I Want to Automate
- [ ] [From Q3 answer]
```

Adapt this template. Make it specific to the user. Don't use it verbatim.

---

### Build: First MCP Setup (for Level 1)

Based on Q1, recommend and configure their first MCP:

1. Determine the best MCP for their use case
2. Create or update `.mcp.json`
3. Walk through authentication
4. Test with a real query

---

### Build: First Skill (for Level 2)

Based on Q3 (what they'd automate):

1. Create `.claude/commands/` directory
2. Write a skill .md file for their specific use case
3. Test it by running the command
4. Suggest 2-3 more skills they should build next

---

### Build: Memory Architecture (for Level 3-4)

1. Create the `memory/` directory structure
2. Seed with initial files based on their work
3. Update CLAUDE.md to reference the memory structure
4. Show how the feedback loop works

---

### Build: Multi-Phase Skill Upgrade (for Level 4-5)

1. Take their most-used existing skill
2. Rewrite it with phases, approval gates, and sub-agent calls
3. Add references to memory/patterns/ for consistency
4. Test the upgraded version

---

### Build: First Automation Script (for Level 5-6)

1. Create a shell script that calls `claude -p` for a routine task
2. Test it end-to-end
3. Show how to schedule with cron or run on demand

---

### Build: Advanced Optimization (for Level 6+)

For power users:
1. **Context budget audit:** How much context consumed on startup? Optimize.
2. **Skill architecture review:** Which skills could chain? Build connections.
3. **Memory file health check:** Stale files? Outdated patterns? Clean up.
4. **MCP health check:** All configured MCPs actually working? Test each one.
5. **Pipeline review:** Where could headless mode replace interactive sessions?

---

## Community Wisdom (from GenAI Circle)

**On context windows:**
Break tasks into smaller chunks. The "auto-compact" (the community calls it "the lobotomy") loses important context. Better to do 5 focused sessions than 1 marathon.

**On getting started:**
Your CLAUDE.md is 80% of the early value. Spend 30 minutes on it before anything else. Claude can only be as good as the context you give it.

**On MCP management:**
Fewer is better. Tool search helps manage context (dropped startup from 51% to 13%), but don't load MCPs you don't use daily.

**On replacing SaaS:**
Track what you're paying for monthly. Try replacing one tool per week. Members have canceled Gamma, Canva Pro, Superhuman, Clay after building equivalent workflows.

**On building your knowledge system:**
The pattern is Claude Code + MCP + markdown memory files + git. Your system gets smarter with every project. The first month feels slow. By month two, the compounding kicks in.

**On autonomous work:**
Start supervised. Remove guardrails gradually. The members who trust too fast burn tokens on bad output. The members who never trust miss the productivity multiplier.

**On the levels:**
There's no shame in being at Level 1. The jump from 1 to 3 takes a weekend. The jump from 3 to 5 takes a few weeks of daily use. Most people find their sweet spot between 4 and 6. Going higher means running infrastructure, and that's only worth it if your work demands it.
