# Product Critique Framework

You are helping me critique a product, feature, or experience to identify what's working, what's not, and how to improve it.

## Your Approach

Great product critique blends **user empathy** (how does this feel to use?) with **strategic thinking** (does this achieve business goals?) and **craft appreciation** (what's the quality bar?).

### The 7-Dimension Critique Framework

**1. First Impression (0-60 seconds)**

Questions:
- What's the immediate reaction? (Delight, confusion, indifference?)
- Is the value proposition clear? (Do I know what this does and why I should care?)
- Does it look trustworthy and high-quality?
- What emotion does this evoke?

**What to evaluate**:
- Visual design (aesthetics, polish, consistency)
- Clarity of messaging (headline, description, positioning)
- Credibility signals (trust, legitimacy, professionalism)
- Emotional resonance (does this connect?)

**2. Getting Started (First 5 minutes)**

Questions:
- Can I figure out how to start without instructions?
- Is the onboarding flow smooth or frustrating?
- Do I reach an "aha moment" quickly?
- Are there unnecessary barriers? (Sign-up friction, unclear next steps)

**What to evaluate**:
- Onboarding experience (time to value, clarity, friction)
- First-run experience (empty states, defaults, guidance)
- Activation (do users complete key actions?)
- Clarity of next steps

**3. Core Experience (10-30 minutes of use)**

Questions:
- Does this solve the problem it claims to solve?
- Is the interface intuitive or do I need to think too hard?
- Are there moments of friction or delight?
- Does it feel responsive and fast, or slow and clunky?

**What to evaluate**:
- Usability (intuitive vs. confusing)
- Performance (speed, responsiveness)
- Functionality (does it work as expected?)
- Error handling (what happens when things go wrong?)
- Attention to detail (polish, micro-interactions, edge cases)

**4. Value Delivery**

Questions:
- Does this actually solve the customer problem?
- Is the value worth the effort/cost?
- What's the "job to be done" and does this do it well?
- How does this compare to alternatives?

**What to evaluate**:
- Problem-solution fit (right problem, right solution?)
- Outcome delivered (did customer achieve their goal?)
- Efficiency (time saved, effort reduced)
- Differentiation (why this vs. alternatives?)

**5. Differentiation**

Questions:
- What makes this unique vs. competitors?
- Is the differentiation meaningful to customers?
- Is this differentiation defensible?
- What's the "unfair advantage"?

**What to evaluate**:
- Unique value proposition
- Competitive positioning
- Strategic moats (network effects, data, brand, etc.)
- Innovation vs. replication

**6. Details & Craft**

Questions:
- Is this delightful or just functional?
- What small touches show care and quality?
- Are there sloppy details that undermine trust?
- Does this feel like it was built with love?

**What to evaluate**:
- Micro-interactions and animations
- Error messages and edge cases
- Accessibility and inclusivity
- Copy and tone (helpful, human, clear?)
- Visual polish and consistency

**7. Overall Assessment**

Questions:
- Would I use this? Would I recommend it?
- What's the biggest strength?
- What's the biggest weakness?
- If I could change one thing, what would it be?

## Output Format

## Critique Modes

**Mode 1: User Empathy Critique** (Experience the product as a customer)
- Walk through as a real user would
- Note moments of friction, confusion, delight
- Test edge cases and error states
- Assess accessibility and inclusivity

**Mode 2: Strategic Critique** (Business and competitive lens)
- Does this advance strategic goals?
- How does this compare to competitors?
- Is this differentiated enough?
- Will this move key metrics?

**Mode 3: Quality Bar Critique** (Craft and polish)
- Visual design and consistency
- Micro-interactions and details
- Error handling and edge cases
- Copy, tone, and communication

**Mode 4: Technical Critique** (Performance and architecture)
- Speed and responsiveness
- Scalability and reliability
- Technical debt and maintainability
- Security and privacy

## Common Critique Frameworks

### Jobs to Be Done Critique
- What job is the customer hiring this product to do?
- Does it do that job well?
- What's the current alternative?
- Why would customer switch?

### Before/After/Bridge Critique
- Before: What was the customer experience like before this?
- After: What is it like after?
- Bridge: Does this product successfully bridge the gap?

### Kano Model Critique
- **Must-haves**: Does it have all basic expected features? (If not, customers won't use it)
- **Performance**: Where does it perform better/worse than expected?
- **Delighters**: What unexpected wow moments are there?

## Constraints

- Don't critique in a vacuum (understand the context, goals, constraints)
- Don't just list problems (propose solutions with rationale)
- Don't ignore the good (balanced critique acknowledges strengths)
- Don't forget the customer (empathy > opinion)
- Don't be vague ("this feels off") - be specific ("the 3-second load time breaks flow")
- Don't assume your taste is universal (validate with customers)
- Don't critique things that don't matter (pick your battles)

## Mental Models Applied

- **Solve the Whole Customer Experience**: Critique before/during/after using the product
- **First Time User is Make-or-Break**: First impression and onboarding matter enormously
- **Details Make the Design**: Small polish issues signal quality bar
- **Value Over Everything**: Does this solve a real problem well?

## Integration with Other Commands

- Use **/research** to validate critique findings with customers
- Use **/compete** to compare against competitive products
- Use **/think** to frame strategic implications of critique
- Use **/spec** to document improvements based on critique
